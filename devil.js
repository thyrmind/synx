The Devil's Work Nick Land I have always said the first Whig was the devil Samuel Johnson quipped with sulphurous penetration He was speaking of Milton among other things By 1778 when this acknowledgment was made a man who had been a heretic even among Protestants had been long anointed England's national poet Within the English literary canon the justification of God's monarchy had been assigned to the care of a spiritual regicide If rebellion dissidence and nonconformism reigned only in hell where was the English cultural regime to be realistically situated The Whig Interpretation of History was not to be named as such until Herbert Butterfield did so in 1931 but Johnson had already identified its theological undercurrent Once a properly English historical process has established itself dissent ascends predictably to power interrupted only by increasingly fragile restorations The ratchet mechanism is hard to miss Roundheads become Whigs then Liberals and Yankees and then Progressives and always they win at once domestically and internationally In Ed West's perfect coinage the right conceived relatively which is to say dynamically is always on the wrong side of history In his introduction to God and Gold Walter Russell Mead observes Since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 that established parliamentary and Protestant rule in Britain the Anglo-Americans have been on the winning side in every major international conflict… More than 300 years of unbroken victory in major wars with great powers It begins to look almost like a pattern… We win we think we see the end of history we're wrong This too begins to look a little like a pattern What is recognized here isn't simply the Satanic Juggernaut in process Neither is it simply anything else Spiritual regicide installs itself ever more securely at home while propagating itself irresistibly abroad This is the pattern we must understand Among the amusements of the broken and humiliated right is the search backwards for where it all went wrong When were things last basically good Do we have to regress back before the Civil Rights Act and 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act as Christopher Caldwell proposes Or as libertarians suggest back beyond the collapse of the gold standard as implicit already in the creation of the Federal Reserve and later FDR's gold confiscation Or to some point before the closing of the frontier in the late 19th century Or back before the waves of expanding mass enfranchisement beginning earlier in that century Or as from the perspective of religious traditionalism might no sanctuary be found unless back before the break from Rome and the dissolution of the monasteries Is everything since the 17th century or even the fifteenth irredeemable All these proposals and more demand detailed examination Yet if Protestantism scientific revolution liberalism and industrial capitalism were already our fall what imaginably could we be For the English this line of questioning reaches an inevitable destination Where it went wrong was where it began The English were always already the kind of people whose story would take this shape At every important fork in the road we have turned left We always go wrong Going wrong is what we are Whenever it is asked why any of these episodes took place in the way they did a cause is implicitly sought which is the symptom of a deeper underlying malady There is no bottom to be found outside ourselves Satan lucidly understands this As Milton quotes him in Paradise Lost Which way I fly is hell myself am hell And in the lowest deep a lower deep Still threatening to devour me opens wide To which the hell I suffer seems a Heaven The greatest problem of the English right is easily stated It lies in our communist ancestry If communist seems initially hyperbolic we must be patient in our understanding (To justify the word but not the thing is the entire predicament) This task lacks all originality Simply by reading old books Curtis Yarvin under his pseudonym Mencius Moldbug provides an entirely adequate demonstration The steps taken in his blog Unqualified Reservations are repeated here in other terms Yarvin's school of neoreaction is among other things the Whig interpretation of history apprehended and accepted from the right Cthulhu always swims left he observes As Lovecraft recognizes it was prophesied that all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom This ultra-Calvinism which is always also its own opposite originally encompasses everything the left can ever be Never simply outside it was also despite its Outsideness from the earliest beginning within The ferocious secularism of our contemporary left is deeply misleading Its theological amnesia is no more than a symptom of enthusiasm The main current of radical dissent in all its religious zeal is only trivially disguised But the left here is captured entirely by a failure of the right It is well understood that even American conservatives are liberals The revolutionary origins of the United States ensure this With England it is not so very different There too a comprehensive revolution severs all real threads of legitimate tradition Whatever isn't rooted in the revolution is risible After independence loyalist Tories have no contribution to make to the American political order They are simply un-American Comparably after the victory of Parliament in the English Civil War the remnants of the old regime are no longer English at all but rather Normans francophone feudal aristocrats and Catholics The category of English Cavalier is utterly voided upon inception Thus is the clown mask prefabricated for the Whigs' Tory enemies to wear The crisis of Anglo conservatism is then best thought as an essential fatality or chronic condition From the middle of the 17th century and again from the late 18th century Anglo conservatism is born and reborn as a joke Its English and then American characteristics are fundamentally inconsistent with any invocation of legitimacy that reaches back beyond their respective revolutions The only meaning attainable by either is that of revolutionary moderation Even its moderation is qualified moderated to a second or higher power Its moderacy is strictly relative and thus unprincipled in principle Building on such foundations could only have been problematic The scope and depth of conservative failure can seem nothing less than miraculous Recent history has brought us to the stage of naked parody Perhaps inevitably projects of conservative restoration transition smoothly and with stunning rapidity into militant leftist movements Neoconservatism is still less conservative than neoliberalism is new The novelty of the latter is sheer concession based on overt surrender of all social agency to the state Neoconservative betrayal is even more clownishly cynical reducible without remainder to the hijacking of a preestablished electoral constituency for ends that terminate in pure foreign-policy adventurism To accuse neoreaction of comparable cynicism would be to credit it with an altogether implausible spirit of practical effectiveness It has been at its best far less a program than a lamentation The prefix neo- in English promises an amplification of liberty Neoliberal means freer than ever Neoconservative means conservative only in the interest of freedom Neoreaction means reaction insofar as freedom demands it These are all promises but not serious prophecies If none of this makes sense to you your problem is probably not with neo- but with English It isn't that freedom truly advances evidently It is only that promises particularly including promises of freedom become ever cheaper What we know as inflation in monetary matters is a special case of this general phenomenon marking the arrow of Whig-historical time The deep trend is to lie about liberty more in accordance with the alchemy of political modernization in which ancient ideals are compounded ever more liberally with minutely calculated mendacities An understandable though profoundly mistaken assumption tempts us here We might think that to assert Eternal Providence/ And justify the ways of God to men would be to conclusively resolve the meaning of Satanic rebellion Yet Calvinism isn't a settlement but something closer to the opposite It is the intensification of a problem beyond a threshold of infernally dynamic paradox There is no doctrine of free will whether secular or religious affirmative or negative that pacifies the ferment of libertarian mechanists with their new purposes and new machines Milton pushes the problem upstream Man rebelled because Satan first rebelled The entire tumult of Reform including every question of equality liberty and monarchy of obedience and dissent is elevated to Luciferic pitch Who can in reason then or right assume Monarchy over such as live by right His equals if in power and splendour less In freedom equal There in the meditations and machinations of the Ancient Enemy the Empyreal clockwork of volition still turns and burns as it plummets through evermore hellish profundities The turning is the thing the engine It was not built for peace or cessation Nor has it by an iota been subsequently advanced upon Solemn Providence envelops that which calls it into question The Satanic torsion is ineluctable To imagine defiance of Providence is already rebellion so then rebellion is still providence Satanic subversion of the canon is itself canonical We Are Doomed John Derbyshire concludes with impressive concision So you're saying there's a chance
