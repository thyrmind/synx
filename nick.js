qabbala = "Qabbala 101 Part 0 Count from 1 10 and you get this Count from 0 9 and you most definitely don't Ten is the summit of theistic qabbalism returning numerical proliferation to a superior unity Nine implicates a reiterated triadic dispersion or proliferating abomination No prizes for guessing the side Lemurians take n-1 You know it makes senselessness Qabbala 101 Part 1 The basic tool of August Barrow's Anglossic Qabbala is the Alphanumeric Gematria Since this numerization of the Neo-Roman alphabet merely continues the procedure now familiar from Hexadecimal A 10 F 15 it proved elusive to qabbalists expecting a traditional gematria As Reza has explained in his introductions to the Abjad these traditional systems whether Hebrew Greek Farsi or Arabic have distinctive typical features 1 They substitute letters for numerical values overcoding numerals where they exist 2 They code for discontinuous numerical values typically 1-10 then 20 30 chunked in decimally significant magnitudes In contrast Barrow's Gematria is a continuous nonredundant system supplementing the numerals 0-9 with numerized letters from A 10 to Z 35 treating the 0-Z alphanumeric sequence as a numeral succession corresponding to the numerals of a modulus 36 notation While there are countless reasons for adopting this convention for the numerical decoding of oecumenic messages Aleister Crowley's system of Magick provides the best evidence of its supreme qabbalistic virtue in respect to the universe of Anglobal communications Why did Crowley entitle his book of qabbalistic essays 777 asks Barrow-Scholar Peter Vysparov This question seems to point to the most astounding qabbalistic datum of modern times the alphanumerically rigorous gematria equation Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law 777 One remarkable feature of this equation is that neither Crowley not any of his followers explicitly recognized the exact qabbalistic identity of the Thelemic Law as stated in The Book of the Law Liber AL vel legis to the numerical index of modern qabbalism 777 & Other Qabalistic sic Writings This relates intriguingly to the topic of secrecy of which more elsewhere Crowley says of The Book of the Law AL is the true name of the Book for these letters and their number 31 form the Master Key to its Mysteries Crowley bases this equation on the Hebrew gematria in which the letter Aleph and Lamed have the values 1 and 30 respectively AL truly earns its status as a key when it is noted that its Anglossic alphanumeric value also equals 31 A 10 L 21 The TX expression of 31 reveals it as the 4th mainline hyprime the 11th prime with the hyprime mainline numbers 2 3 5 11 31 and 127 all being of prominent importance within Thelemic Magick although this system of connections once again seems nowhere to be explicitly emphasized 31 is also a Mersenne number In a strange Hyprime mainline reflex it corresponds to alphanumeric V 127 the 31st prime TX NUMBER THELEMA CRYPT Qabbalize and sum the names of the Sephirot as Romanized by Crowley and including DAATH 11th Sephirot total 1270 Vysparov even cruelly suggested that Crowley's entire magickal career was a cosmic joke whose sole purpose was the unwitting demonstration of the Barrow gematria As for Allala Current 93 the Crowley Tarot more on the Sephirot later Qabbala 101 Part 2 Popular Numeracy Warning hyperstitionally unprocessed and qabbalistically naive pretentious meta-discourse The ocean in which qabbalism swims is not mathematics but popular numerical culture From a mathematical perspective it remains undeveloped even ineducable since it cannot advance beyond the Natural number line even to the level of the Rationals let alone to the higher numbers or set-theoretical post-numerical spaces Where counting ceases qabbalism becomes impracticable Socially qabbala makes an implicit decision against specialization in order to remain virtually coincidental with the entire economy of digitizable signs It is essentially democratic in the most inclusive sense of this word even when apparently lost in its own trappings of hermeticism It is bound to the blind undirected contingencies of pre-reflective mass social phenomena with all the inarticulate provocation this entails in respect to professional intellectuals Wherever exact semiotic exchange occurs a latent qabbalism lurks even within the enclaves of intellectual professionalism themselves Deleuze & Guattaris Nomad War Machine within which number is socially subjectivized captures crucial aspects of this qabbalistic fatality Historically qabbala arises through epic accident as a side-product of the transition between distinct modes of decimal notation Its historical presupposition is the shift from alphabetical numerals of the Hebrew or Greek type to modular notation with its resulting unlocalizable and theoretically indeterminable confusion This transition provided the opportunity for a systematic calculative error the mistaken application of elementary techniques appropriate to alphabetical numerals simple addition of notated values to the new modular signs This mistake automatically resulted in digital reduction by accident and thus as a theoretically scandalous gift of fate Arising historically during the European Renaissance when zero place value and technocapitalism finally breached the ramparts of Western monotheism qabbalism born in a semiotic glitch and thus lacking the authority of tradition or even purpose was compelled to hyperstitionally generate an extreme antiquity for itself in a process that is still ongoing Technically qabbala is inextricable from digital processing Emerging from calculative practicality within the context of blind mass-cultural metamorphosis it antedates it own theoretical legitimation making sense of itself only derivatively sporadically and contentiously Its situation is analogous and perhaps more than analogous to that of a spontaneous artificial intelligence achieving partial lucidity only as a consequence of tidal pragmatic trends that ensure an integral default of self-mastery Practical systematization of technique precedes any conceivable theoretical motivation Dialectical interrogation of qabbalism at the level of explicit motivation thus proves superficial and inconsequential essentially misrecognizing the nature of the beast It is equally misleading to ask What is a computer really for Politically qabbalism repels ideology As a self-regenerating mass-cultural glitch it mimics the senseless exuberance of virus profoundly indifferent to all partisan considerations Indifferent even to the corroded solemnity of nihilism it sustains no deliberated agendas It stubbornly adheres to a single absurd criterion its intrinsic condition of existence continual unconscious promotion of numerical decimalism Qabbala destines each and every strategic appropriation to self-parody and derision beginning with the agenda of theocratic resoration that attended its ludicrously robed baptismal rites Even God was unable to make sense of it It has no party only popularity So lets party Qabbala 101 Part 3 Primitive Numerization Among the primary test-beds for qabbalistic analysis are the numerolexic systems inherited from cultures overcoded by the modern Oecumenic alphabet These include the Hebrew and Greek alphabets with their Neoroman letter names and mathematico-notational functions and the Roman numbers inherited as Neoroman letters and still numerically active in various domains In this respect the absence of names for Neoroman letters are an index of their pseudo-transcendence as unnameable within the present Oecumenic order A discontinuity is marked in the alphanumeric series 0-Z by the fact that the numerals composing the first 10 figures in this series do have names grouping them with the letters of previous alphabetical numbering systems from a certain qabbalistic perspective This might be taken as the residual indication of an alien quality still characterizing the numerals in relation to the Oecumenic cultural order they now indisputably occupy a legacy of the cultural trauma attending their introduction The qabbalistic provocation posed by this English number names is conceptually comparable to that of any other numerolexic system while surpassing any other in the intimacy of its challenge If the numerals have names shouldnt the qabbalistic processing of them as words yield at the least compelling suggestions of nonrandom signal If the standard numeral names emit nothing but noise when qabbalistically transcoded the attempt to establish relatively persuasive criteria for the evaluation of qabbalistic results suffers an obvious and immense reverse What then would count as a minimally controversial first step in such an examination Surely the most basic of all qabbalistic or subqabbalistic procedures is simple letter counting Primitive Numerization PN As a reversion to sheer tallying PN has a resonance with the most archaic traces of numerical practice such as simple strokes carved into mammoth bones and suchlike palaeo-ethnographic materials If anyone was to bother systematizing PN procedure for the purpose of mechanization or simply for conceptual clarity it would be most efficiently done by transcoding ciphering each letter or notational element as 1 and then processing the result numerically PNs extremely tenuous relation to issues of modulus-notation ensures that it can only ever be a highly dubious tool when intricate qabbalistic calculation is required Yet this utter crudity also makes it invaluable as a test case since it minimizes axiomatic arbitrariness and precludes any plausible possibility of symbolic conjuration sleight of hand while fully sharing the qabbalistic deficiency of sufficient anthroposocial or communicative motivation Common reason sanity insists upon noise as the only PN output consistent with the general intelligibility of signs a pre-judgement applying rigorously to all qabbalistic procedures No message should inhere in the length of a word excepting only the broad pragmatic trend to the shortening of commonly used terms It is immediately obvious why this exception has no pertinence to the case in question here unless stretched to a point for instance expecting the smaller numerals to exhibit the greatest lexical attrition where it is straightforwardly contradicted by the actuality of the phenomenon So proceeding to the analysis PN of the English numeral names ZERO 4 ONE 3 TWO 3 THREE 5 FOUR 4 FIVE 4 SIX 3 SEVEN 5 EIGHT 5 NINE 4 Is there a pattern here Several levels of apparent noise noise and pseudo-pattern can be expected to entangle themselves in this result depending on the subsequent analytical procedures employed To restrict this discussion to the most evident secondary result not only is there a demonstrable pattern but this pattern complies with the single defining feature of the Numogram the five Syzygies emerging from 9-sum twinning of the decimal numerals 54 63 72 81 90 In the shape most likely to impress common reason entirely independent of numogrammatic commitments this demonstration takes the form ZERO NINE ONE EIGHT TWO SEVEN THREE SIX FOUR FIVE revealing perfect numerolexic-arithmetical PN-qabbalistic consistency PN confirmation of the Numogrammatic Novazygons 9-Twins ONE EIGHT NINE ZERO PN 3 5 4 4 8 TWO SEVEN NINE ZERO PN 3 5 4 4 8 THREE SIX NINE ZERO PN 5 3 4 4 8 FOUR FIVE NINE ZERO PN 4 4 4 4 8 The approximate probability of this pattern emerging by chance is 1 243 if it is assumed that each decimal digit 0-9 is equiprobably allotted an English name of three four or five letter length with 8-sum zygosys as the principle of synthesis 7-sum or 9-sum zygosys are inconsistent with any five or three letter number-names respectively and thus complicate probabilistic analysis beyond the scope of this demonstration although if everything is conceded to the most elaborate conceivable objections of common reason the probability of this phenomenon representing an accident of noise remains comfortably below 1 100 Partisans of common reason can take some comfort from the octozygonic disturbance of the novazygonic Numogrammatic reference How did nine become eight or vice versa Lemurophiliac numogrammaticists are likely to counter such queries with elementary qabbala since digital cumulation and reduction bridges the lesser abyss in two steps 8 36 9 as diagrammed by the 8th Gate connecting Zn-8 to Zn-9 This is a step on the path to a discussion of time-travel honestly Qabbala 101 Part 4 Against Numerology Consider first an extraordinarily direct numerological manifesto “When the qualitative aspects are included in our conception of numbers they become more than simple quantities 1 2 3 4 they acquire an archetypal character as Unity Opposition Conjunction Completion They are then analogous to more familiar Jungian archetypes ” It is hard to imagine a more archetypal expression of numerological ambition than this Yet rather than meeting this claim with docile compliance the qabbalist is compelled to raise a number of awkward questions 1 How can a numerological coding that proceeds in this fashion avoid entrapping itself among the very smallest of Naturals at the toe-damping edge of the number line If 4 symbolizes the archetype Completion what to make of 127 709 1023 or similar small Naturals Do they also have analogues among the intelligible archetypes How would one qualitize 2^127-1 or a larger number of which there are a very considerable number 2 Is an archetype more basic than a number in its unsymbolized state Does qualitizing a number reveal a more elementary truth a germ the number itself conceals or does it merely re-package the number for convenient anthropomorphic consumption gift-wrapping the intolerable inhumanity of alogical numerical difference and connectivity 3 Why should a number be considered quantitative in its Natural state Is it not that the imposition of a quantity quality categorization upon the number requires a logical or philosophical overcoding a projection of intelligibility alien to the number itself Quantity is the decadence of number while quality is its perversion so since arithmetic provides no basis for a reduction of the numerical to the quantitative what is the supposed source of this numeric-quantitative identification other than a disabling preliminary innumeracy 4 If 1 numerologically evokes Unity why should UNITY not qabbalistically evoke 134 8 its Numogrammtic twin with equal pertinence Can any expressible archetype avoid re-dissolution into the unfamiliarity of raw number pattern Numerology might assimilate 2 to opposition but OPPOSITION 238 13 4 twice 2 and the Numogrammatic twin of 4 COMPLETION 212 5 while even if numerological 3 as CONJUNCTION 237 12 3 finds itself qabbalisitically confirmed at the extremity of its decimalization this is not perhaps in an altogether comfortable mode Numerology may be fascinated by numbers but its basic orientation is profoundly antinumerical It seeks essentially to redeem number through symbolic absolution into a higher significance As if the concept of opposition represented an elevation above the mere number two rather than a restriction subjectivization logicization and generalized perversion directed to anthropomorphic use-value and psychological satisfaction Archetypes are sad limitations of the species while numbers are an eternal hypercosmic delight Nevertheless qabbalism is right up against numerology insofar as it arises here within a specific biological and logocratic environment The errors of numerology are only the common failures of logic and philosophy human vanities crudified in the interest of mass dissemination but essentially uncorrupted The numeric-critique or transcendental arithmetic of a Goedel or Turing or Chaitin or Badiou can be rigorously transferred to this controversy demonstrating within each particular milieu that overcodings of numerical relation by intelligible forms archetypes or logics are unsustainable reductions reefed on the unsurpassable semiotic potency of number Goedel has shown that there is always a number in fact an infinitude of Natural numbers that simulate parody logically dialectize paradoxically dismantle archetypally hypervert and in whatever way necessary subvert each and every overcoding of arithmetic Number cannot be superseded There is no possibility of an authoritative philosophy of arithmetic or numerological gnosis Qabbala assumes that semiotics is always already cryptography that the cryptographic sphere is undelimitable It proceeds on the assumption that there cannot be an original unproblematic coding providing the basis for any solid definition or archetypal symbol since the terms required for such a coding are incapable of attaining the pure arbitrariness that would ensure the absence of prior cryptographic investment There is not and can never be any plain text except as a naive political assumption about the relative noninsidiousness of coding agencies and the presupposition that communicative signs accessibly exist that are not already in code Since everything is coded or at least potentially coded nothing is definitively symbolic Qabbalistic cryptocultures even those yet to come ensure that number cannot be discussed or situated without subliminal or more typically wholly unconscious participation in numerical practices Logos including that of numerology is also always something other than itself and in fact very many things Qabbalism thus operates as an inverse or complementary Goedelian double-coding Where Goedel demonstrated that the number line is infested by virtual discursive systems of undelimitable topicality and complexity pre-emptively dismantling the prospects of any conceivable supranumerical metadiscourse qabbala demonstrates that discourses are themselves intrinsically redoubled and further multiplied by coincidental numerical systems which enter into patterns of connectivity entirely independent of logical regimentation The supposed numerical de-activation of the alphabet marking semiotic modernity the era of specialized numerical signs has an extremely fragile foundation relying as it does upon the discontinuation of specific cultural procedures precisely those that withdraw into occultism rather than essential characteristics of signs themselves The persistent numerical functionalization of the modern alphabet with sorting procedures based on alphabetical ordering as the most prominent example provides incontestible evidence if any was required that the semiotic substructure of all Oecumenic communications remains stubbornly amphibious between logos and nomos perpetually agitated by numerical temptations and uncircumscribed polyprocesses At the discursive level any rigorization of qabbala can only be a floating city with each and every definition argument and manifesto continually calving off into unmasterable numerical currents and alogical resonances How could qabbala be counterposed to a code to meaning and reason when CODE 63 finds duplicitous harmonics in MEANING REASON 126 If qabbala positions itself discursively AGAINST NUMEROLOGY 369 the echoes of its novanomic signature perpetuate themselves even through such unlikely terms as SIGNIFICANCE 207 and SIGNIFICATION 252 Pronouncements that begin as projected logical discriminations revert to variations on triplicity and the number nine performing a base qabbalistic subversion of philosophical legislation and its authority to define or delimit connectivity No polemic against numerology whether conducted in the name of qabbala or of Oecumenic common reason will transcend the magmic qabbalistic flux that multiplies and mutates its sense Perhaps dreams of numerological archetypes even sharpen the lust for semiotic invention opening new avenues for qabbalistic incursion But this at least is certain Numbers do not require and will never find any kind of logical redemption They are an eternal hypercosmic delight";
calend = "Calendric Dominion Contents Introduction Calendric Dominion Part 1 Anno Domini Part 2 Year Zero Part 3 Caesar with the soul of Christ Part 4 Counter Calendars Part 5 From Crimson Paradise to Soft Apocalypse Part 6 Countdown Introduction Calendric Dominion was composed as a series of six posts on the first Urban Future blog over a period of five weeks from September November 2011 Initially stimulated by an outburst of traditionalist opposition to the re-coding of the global calendar into very superficially neutral terms it aims to exaggerate rather than to appease sectarian discomfort in order to awaken a question of cultural destiny The topic it orbits is not of a nature to be easily dispelled Could a change in the governing cultural order of the world find a new or old reflection for itself in a profound adjustment of date reckoning conventions The historical precedent for such an upheaval strongly suggests that any transition of this kind would encounter formidable obstacles The world is locked into a story it scarcely understands which entangles it all the more tightly for that This it seems is how things have to proceed for quite a while It is through such impersonal stubbornness that destiny is made manifest What then are the implications of a Calendric Dominion which exceeds its apparent meaning in multiple directions while integrating the cultures of the world into a single system of numerical attachments This is a question that has scarcely begun to register For it to be sharpened further requires time and time is what it stamps for us Eventually this will matter Nick Land December 2013 Calendric Dominion Part 1 Anno Domini Modernity and hegemony are Urban Future obsessions which might at least in part excuse a link to this article 1 in Britains Daily Mail on the topic of Christianity the calendar and political correctness It addresses itself to the international dominion of the Gregorian Western Christian calendar and the sensitivities of those who whilst perhaps reconciled to the inevitability of counting in Jesus-years remain determined to dis-evangelize the accompanying acronymics More particularly it focuses upon the BBC and its attempt to sensitize on other peoples behalf pass the popcorn The BBC s religious and ethics department says the changes are necessary to avoid offending non-Christians It states As the BBC is committed to impartiality it is appropriate that we use terms that do not offend or alienate non-Christians In line with modern practice BCECE Before Common Era Common Era are used as a religiously neutral alternative to BCAD But the move has angered Christians Cue Ann Widdecombe the Catholic former Tory Minister who said I think what the BBC is doing is offensive to Christians They are discarding terms that have been around for centuries and are well understood by everyone What are they going to do next Get rid of the entire calendar on the basis that it has its roots in Christianity Its an interesting question and the attempt to hold it open as provocatively as possible might be the best reason to avoid glib politically correct remedies to the problem however that is understood Anno Domini reminds us of dominion which is a far better guideline into historical reality than kumbaya gestures towards a Common Era as if hegemony had no content beyond togetherness Since dominion has not been achieved primarily by impoliteness or insensitivity politically correct multiculturalism is an irrelevant and dishonest response to it Regardless of whether Jesus is your Lord or not the Christian calendar dominates or at least predominates and the traditional acronymic accurately registers that fact AD bitchez as the commentators of Zerohedge 2 might say It is an intriguing and ineluctable paradox of globalized modernity that its approximation to universality remains fundamentally structured by ethno-geographical peculiarities of a distinctly pre-modern type The world was not integrated by togetherness but by a succession of particular powers with their characteristic traits legacies and parochialisms For better or for worse these peculiar features have been deeply installed in the governing order of the world Their signs should be meticulously conserved and studied rather than clumsily effaced because they are critical clues to the real nature of fate Without exception calendars are treasure troves of intricately sedimented ethno-historical information They attempt to solve an ultimately insoluble problem by arithmetically rationalizing irrational astronomical quantities most obviously the incommensurable cycles of the terrestrial orbit solar year lunar orbit month and terrestrial rotation day No coherent arithmetical construct can ever reconcile these periods and even a repulsively inelegant calendar can only do so to a tolerable margin of error The consequent ramshackle compromise typically deformed by a torturous series of adjustments reshufflings and intercalations tells an elaborate story of fixed and variable cultural priorities regime changes legacy constraints alien influences conceptual capabilities and observational refinements further complicated by processes of drift adoption and innovation that ripple through numerical and linguistic signs The hegemonic Gregorian calendar for instance is a jagged time-crash of incommensurable periods in which multiple varieties of disunity jostle together Weeks dont fit into solar and lunar months or years but cut through them quasi-randomly so that days and dates slide drunkenly across each other The length of the week is biblical but the names of the days combine ancient astrology Saturday-Monday with the gods of Norse mythology Tuesday-Friday Although the Nordic-linguistic aspect of the week has not been strongly globalized its Judeo-numerical aspect has The months are a ghastly mess awkwardly mismatched with each other with the lunar cycle and with the succession of weeks and testifying to the confused erratic astro-politics of the Roman Empire in their linguistic mixture of deities January March April May June festivals February emperors July August and numbers September-December There is no need to excavate into this luxuriant dung-hill here except to note that the Christianity of the Western calendar rests upon chaos-rotted pagan and poly-numeric foundations What matters to the AD-BC vs CE-BCE debate is not the multitudinously-muttering inner disorder of the Western calendar but its estimation of the years or era In this regard it has clear competitors and thus arouses definite resentments since its closest cousins assert eras of their own The era of the Hebrew calendar dates back to the tohu chaos of the year before creation and records the years of the world Latinized as Anno Mundi to the present 5772 AM The Islamic calendar which begins from the Hejira of Mohammed from Mecca to Medina reached 1432 AH in AD 2011 The Christian calendar first systematized in AD 525 by Dionysius Exiguus Dennis the Runt counts the first Anno Domini Nostri Iesu Christi as the birth year of Jesus Ben Joseph a false messiah to the Jews the Christ and Redeemer for the Christians a prophet to the Moslems the Nazarene oppressor to Satanists and something else or nothing much to everybody else Regardless of the accuracy of its chronology or tacit theology however this is the year count that has been globally inherited from the real process of modernity and recognized as a world standard by the United Nations among other international organizations Compared to the Abrahamic calendars those of Asias demographic giants generally lacked tight doctrinal and didactic focus India can usually be relied upon to inundate any topic whatsoever in delirious multiplicity and the calendar is no exception Bengali Malayalam and Tamil calendars are all widely used in their respective regions the Indian National Calendar counts from AD 78 0 which in ominous keeping with current events places us in 1933 and the most widely accepted Hindu religious calendar total the years since the birth of Krishna reaching 5112 in AD 2011 The fabulous complexity of Chinas traditional calendar makes it a paradise for nerds 3 Most commonly it counts the years of each imperial reign and is thus integrated by a literary narrative of dynastic history rather than an arithmetical continuum The obstacle this presented to modernistic universalization is brutally obvious Alternatively however it groups historical time into sixty-year cycles beginning from 2637 BC which places us in the 28th year of cycle-78 Most Chinese today seem to have an extremely tenuous connection to this dimension of their calendrical heritage which scarcely survives outside academic departments of ancient history and in Daoist temples Whilst the internal structure of the traditional year survives undamaged as attested by the annual cycle of festivities Chinese surrender to the Gregorian year count seems absolute Christian conservatives are surely right to argue that it is the year count the number and the era that matters The acronyms are merely explanatory and even essentially tautological Once it has been decided that history is measured from and divided by the birth of Jesus it is far too late to quibble over the attribution of dominance AD bitchez That argument is over Notes 1 Available online at

httpwwwmathnusedusgaslaksencalendarcalpdf Part 2 Caesar with the soul of Christ Political Correctness has tacitly legislated against the still-prevailing acronyms that define the hegemonic international calendar BC-AD and proposed clear alternatives BCE-CE Both the criticism and the suggestion are entirely consistent with its principles In accordance with the tenets of multiculturalism a more recent and also more active hegemony it extends the liberal assumption of formal equality from individuals to cultures allocating group rights and identifying whilst immediately denouncing discrimination and privilege As might be expected from an ideology that is exceptionally concentrated among intellectual elites the proposed remedy is purely symbolic taking the form of a rectification of signs The problem is diagnosed as a failure of consciousness or sensitivity requiring only a raising of awareness to be effected one can safely assume by properly credentialed and compensated professionals Even considered in its own terms however the rectification that is suggested amounts to nothing more than an empty gesture of refusal accompanying fundamental compliance Whilst the symbolic left draw comfort from the insistence upon inconsequential change with its intrinsic offense against conservative presumptions reinforced by an implied moral critique of tradition the counterbalancing indignation of the right fixes the entire dispute within the immobilized trenches of the Anglo-American culture war The deep structure of calendric signs persists unaffected Between Christian dominion invoking Our Lord and a common era that is obediently framed by the dating of Christian revelation there is no difference that matters It is the count that counts Political Correctness fails here in the same way it always does due to its disconnection of correctness from any rigorous principle of calculation and its disengagement of sensitivity from realistic perception A calendar is a profound cultural edifice orchestrating the apprehension of historical time As such it is invulnerable to the gnat-bites of ideological irritability and dominance is not reducible to impoliteness The problem of Western Calendric Dominion is not one of supremacism etiquette but of supremacy historical fatality It might be posed How did modernistic globalization come to be expressed as Christian Oecumenon In large measure this is Max Webers question and Walter Russell Meads but it overflows the investigations of both in the direction of European and Middle Eastern antiquity Initial stimulation for this inquiry is provided by a strange even fantastic coincidence In his notebooks Friedrich Nietzsche imagined the overman Übermensch as a Caesar with the soul of Christ a chimerical being whose tensions echo those of the Church of Rome Latinized Christian liturgy and the Western calendar This hybridity is expressed by a multitude of calendric features following a broad division of labor between a Roman structuring of the year within which with superficially-Christianized pagan festivals are scattered unsystematically and a Christian year count but it also points towards a cryptic even radically unintelligible plane of fusion In the Year Zero which never took place a mysterious synchronization occurred imperceptibly and unremarked founding the new theopolitical calendric order For the Christians who would not assimilate the Empire until the reign of Constantine in the early 4th century AD God was incarnated as man in the embryo of Jesus Christ Simultaneously in a Rome that was perfectly oblivious to the conception of the Messiah the Julian calendar became operational Julius Caesars calendric reform had begun 45 years earlier following the Years of Confusion but incompetent execution in subsequent decades had systematically mis-timed the leap year intercalating a day every three years rather than every four The anomalous triennial cycle was abandoned and the Roman calendar was finally aligned to the Julian calendar in 1 BC with AD 1 the first full year of alignment although no special significance would be assigned to these years until Dionysius Exiguus integrated Christian history in AD 525 Given the astounding neglect of this twin event some additional emphasis is appropriate The Julian calendar which would persist unmodified for almost 1600 years and which still dominates colloquial understanding of the years length at 36525 days was born by sheer and outrageous chance at the precise origin of the Christian Era as registered by the Western and now international numbering of historical time The year count thus exactly simulates a commemoration of the calendar itself or at least of its prototype even though the birth of this calendar whether understood in the terms of secular reason or divine providence has absolutely no connection to the counted beginning This is a coincidence which is to say a destiny perceived without comprehension that neither Roman authority nor Christian revelation has been able to account for even as it surreptitiously shapes Western and then Global history As the worlds dominant calendar counts the years under what appears to be a particular religious inspiration it refers secretly to its own initiation alluding to mysteries of time that are alien to any faith That much is simple fact Unlike the Julian calendar the Gregorian calendar was determined under Christian auspices or at least formal Christian authority that of Pope Gregory XIII and promulgated by papal bull in 1582 Yet a glance suffices to reveal the continuation of Julian calendric dominion since the Gregorian reform effects transformations that remain strictly compliant with the Julian pattern modified only by elementary operations of decimal re-scaling and inversion Where the Julian calendar took four years as its base cyclical unit the Gregorian takes four centuries and where the Julian adds one leap day in four years the Gregorian leaves one and subtracts three in 400 The result was an improved approximation to the tropical year averaging 36524219 days from the Julian 36525 year to the Gregorian 3652425 a better than 20-fold reduction in discrepancy from an average 000781 days per year drifting off the seasons by one day every 128 years to 000031 drifting one day every 3226 years The combination of architectonic fidelity with technical adjustment defines conservative reform It is clearly evident in this case A neo-Julian calendar structured in its essentials at its origin in AD 1 minus 1 but technically modified at the margin in the interest of improved accuracy armed the West with the worlds most efficient large-scale time-keeping system by the early modern period In China where the Confucian literati staged competitions to test various calendars from around the world against the prediction of eclipses Jesuits equipped with the Gregorian calendar prevailed against all alternatives ensuring the inexorable trend towards Western calendric conventions or at least the firm identification of Western methods with modernistic efficiency Given only an edge in China and elsewhere the dynamics of complex systems took over as network effects locked-in the predominant standard whilst systematically marginalizing its competitors Even though Year Zero was still missing it was ever increasingly missing at the same time for everyone Caeser with the soul of Christ the master of Quadrennium and eclipse had installed itself as the implicit meaning of world history Part 3 Year Zero A Year Zero signifies a radical re-beginning making universal claims In modern especially recent modern times it is associated above all with ultra-modernist visions of total politics at is maximum point of utopian and apocalyptic extremity The existing order of the world is reduced to nothing from which a new history is initiated fundamentally disconnected from anything that occurred before and morally indebted only to itself Predictably enough among conservative commentators in the widest sense such visions are broadly indistinguishable from the corpse-strewn landscapes of social catastrophe haunted by the ghosts of unrealizable dreams Christianity s global Calendric Dominion is paradoxical perhaps even dialectical in this regard It provides the governing model of historical rupture and unlimited ecumenical extension and thus of total revolution whilst at the same time representing the conservative order antagonized by modernistic ambition Its example incites the lurch to Year Zero even as it has no year zero of its own Ultimately its dialectical provocation tends towards Satanic temptation the promise of Anti-Christian Apocalypse or absolute news to a second power If the Christians could do it why couldn t we Cue body-counts scaling up towards infinity This tension exists not only between an established Christian order and its pseudo-secular revolutionary after-image but also within Christianity itself which is split internally by the apparent unity and real dissociation of messianic time The process of Christian calendric consolidation was immensely protracted A distance of greater than half a millennium separated the clear formulation of the year count from the moment commemorated with further centuries required to fully integrate historical recording on this basis digesting prior Jewish Roman and local date registries and laying the foundation for a universalized Christian articulation of time By the time the revolutionary good news had been coherently formalized into a recognizable prototype of the hegemonic Western calendar it had undergone a long transition from historical break to established tradition with impeccable conservative credentials Simultaneously however the process of calendric consolidation sustained and even sharpened the messianic expectation of punctual and truly contemporary rupture projected forwards as duplication or second coming of the initial division Even if the moment in which history had been sundered into two parts before and after BC and AD now lay in quite distant antiquity its example remained urgent and promissory Messianic hope was thus torn and compacted by an intrinsic historical doubling which stretched it between a vastly retrospective gradually recognized beginning and a prospect of sudden completion whose credibility was assured by its status as repetition What had been would be again transforming the AD count into a completed sequence that was confirmed in the same way it was terminated through Messianic intervention Unsurprisingly the substantial history of Western calendric establishment is twinned with the rise of millenarianism through phases that trend to increasingly social-revolutionary forms and eventually make way for self-consciously anti-religious although decidedly eschatological varieties of modernistic total politics Because whatever has happened must at least be possible the very existence of the calendar supports anticipations of absolute historical rupture Its count simply by beginning prefigures an end What starts can re-start or conclude Zero however intrudes diagonally It even introduces a comic aspect since whatever the importance of the Christian revelation to the salvation of our souls it is blatantly obvious that it failed to deliver a satisfactory arithmetical notation For that Christian Europe had to await the arrival of the decimal numerals from India via the Moslem Middle East and the ensuing revolution of calculation and book-keeping that coincided with the Renaissance along with the birth of mercantile capitalism in the city states of northern Italy Indeed for anybody seeking a truly modern calendar the Arrival of Zero would mark an excellent occasion for a new year zero AZ 0 around AD 1500 Yet although this would plausibly date the origin of modernity the historical imprecision of the event counts against it In addition the assimilation of zero by germinal European and thus global capitalism was evidently gradual if comparatively rapid rather than a punctual revolutionary transition of the kind commemorative calendric zero is optimally appropriate to If Year Zero is thus barred from the designation of its own world-historic operationalization it is perhaps structurally doomed to misapplication and the production of disillusionment The conspicuous absence of zero from the Western calendar count exposed in its abrupt jolt from 1 BC to AD 1 is an intolerable and irreparable stigma that brings its world irony to a zenith In the very operation of integrating world history in preparation for planetary modernity it remarks its own debilitating antiquity and particularity in the most condescending modern sense of the limited and the primitive crude defective and underdeveloped How could a moment of self-evident calculative incompetence provide a convincing origin-point for subsequent historical calculation Year Zero escaped all possibility of conceptual apprehension at the moment in the time-count where it is now seen to belong and infinity the cryptic reciprocal of zero proves no less elusive Infinity was inserted into a time when and place where it demonstrably made no sense and the extraordinary world-historical impression that it made did nothing not even nothing to change that situation Is this not a worthy puzzle for theologians Omnipotent omniscient omnibenevolent yet hopeless at maths these are not the characteristics of a revelation designed to impress technologists or accountants All the more reason then to take this comedy seriously in all its ambivalence since the emerging world of technologists and accountants the techno-commercial runwayindustrial or capitalist world that would globalize the earth was weaned within the playpen of this calendar and no other Modernity had selected to date itself in a way that its own kindergarten students would scorn Part 4 Counter Calendars Between the world we would like to inhabit and the world that exists theres a gap that tests us Even the simplest description of this gap already calls for a decision Ideologies in the broadest and culturally almost all-consuming sense serve primarily to soften it Sense and even compassion is attributed to the side of reality promising ultimate reconciliation between human hopes and desires and the objective nature of things Science a typically despised and misanthropic discipline tends to the opposite assumption emphasizing the harsh indifference of reality to human interests and expectations with the implication that the lessons it teaches us can be administered with unlimited brutality We can dash ourselves against reality if we insist but we cannot realistically anticipate some merciful moderation of the consequences Nature does not scold or punish it merely breaks us coldly upon the rack of our untruths Like other cultural institutions calendars are saturated with ideologies and tested to destruction against implacable reality Their collision with nature is especially informative because they express obstinate human desires as favored numbers selected from among small positive integers and they register the gulf of the real in a strictly quantitative form Any surviving calendar relates the story of an adaptation to reality or cultural deference to and deformation by nature as numerical preferences have been compromised through their encounter with quantitative facts Pure ideology in the calendrical sphere is represented in its perfection by the fantasy year of the ancient Mesopotamians 360 days in length and harmonized to the sexagesimal modulus-60 arithmetic of the Sumerians Its influence has persisted in the 360 degrees of the geometric circle and in the related sexagesimal division into minutes and seconds of time and arc The archaic calendars of Meso-America and East Asia as well as those of the Middle East seem to have been attracted to the 360-day year as though to an ideal model If the Great Architect of the Universe had been an anthropomorphic geometer this is the calendar that would work Of course it doesnt with all due respect to the engrossing Biblical counter-argument outlined here 1 Instead in the mainstream world calendric tradition as determined by the eventual global outcome a first level adaptation systematized the year at 365 days the Egyptian year Unlike the 360-day archetypal year which has all of the first three primes as factors and thus divides conveniently into months or other component periods the 365-day year represents a reluctant concession to quantitative fact The number 365 has only two factors both primes 5 and 73 but neither seems to have acquired any discernible calendrical valency perhaps because of their obvious unsuitability to even approximate description of lunar periods The Egyptians turned instead to an awkward but influential innovation the intercalation A five-day appendix was added to the year as a sheer correction or supplementary commensuration and an annual reminder of the gap between numerical elegance and astronomical reality Whilst intercalations were invested with mytho-religious significance this was essentially compensatory a crudely obscured testament to the weakness of ideality and thus of systematic priest-craft as a mode of reality apprehension or efficient social purpose If intercalations were necessary then nature was not spell-bound and the priestmasters of calendric time were exposed tacitly as purveyors of mystification whose limits were drawn by the horizon of social credulity Astronomical time mocked the meanings of men Over time the real tropical year discredits its calendrical idealizations by unmooring dates from the seasons in a process of time drift that exposes discrepancy and drives calendar reform Inaccurate calendars are gradually rendered meaningless as the seasonal associations of its time terms are eroded to utter randomness by frigid summer months and scorching winter ones Clearly no priesthood can survive in a climate that derides the established order of the year and in which farmers that listen to the holy words of time are assured inevitable starvation Unless tracked within a tolerable margin of accuracy by a calendar that keeps the time the year reverts to an alien and unintelligible thing entirely exterior to cultural comprehension whilst societys reigning symbols appear as a risible senseless babble drowned out by the howling chaos of the real With the introduction of the Julian calendar coinciding with the non-event of Year Zero comes the recognition that the tropical year is incommensurable with any integer and that a larger cycle of intercalation is required to track it A kind of modernity or structural demystification is born with the relinquishment of the ideal year and everything it symbolizes in terms of cosmic design or celestial harmony The devils appendix is attached irremovably Numeracy and time measurement divorce at the origin of caesarean Calendric Dominion but it is easy to mistake accidents on this path for essential concessions to reality Even allowing for the inescapable function of intercalations there was nothing inevitable at least absolutely or cosmically inevitable about the utter ruination of numerical coherence that the Julian calendar incarnated and passed on To explore this admittedly arcane topic further requires a digression to the second power into the relations between numbers and anthropomorphic desire The obvious starting point is the 360- day calendar of ancient Sumer and the question What made this number appealing Whether examining 360 or its sexagesimal root 60 an arithmetically-conventional attention to prime factors 2 3 and 5 is initially misleading although ultimately indispensable A more illuminating introduction begins with the compound factors 10 and 12 the latter relevant primarily to the lunar cycle and the archaic dream of an astronomically or rather astrologically consistent 12-month year and the former reflecting the primordial anthropomorphism in matters numeric decimalism The 360-day calendar is an object of human desire because it is an anthropolunar or menstrual-lycanthropic hybrid speaking intrinsically to the cycles of human fertility and to the digital patterns instantiated in mammalian body-plans A 360-day year would be ours even if alien things are hidden in it Anthropomorphic decimalism suggests how certain numerical opportunities went missing along with zero Apprehension and comprehension refer understanding to the prehensile organs of a specific organism whose bilateral symmetry combines five-fingered hands to produce a count reaching ten across an interval that belongs to an alien intractable third Triadic beings are monsters and decimally ungraspable The bino-decimal structure of the Yi Jing exhibits this with total clarity through its sixstage time-cycle that counts in the recurrent sequence 1 2 4 8 7 5 Each power of three within the decimal numerals is expelled along with zero from the order of apprehensible time There is no way that a ternary calendric numeracy could ever have been anthropomorphically acceptable the very thought is almost definitionally abominable Yet astronomy seems hideously complicit with abomination at least if the years are twinned The sixth power of three 36 approximates to the length of two tropical years with a discrepancy of just 148438 days or less than one day a year An intercalation of three days every four years or two twin-year cycles brings it to the accuracy of the Julian calendar and a reduction of this intercalation by one day every 128 years or 64 26 twin-year cycles exceeds the accuracy of the Gregorian calendar It might be necessary to be slightly unbalanced to fully appreciate this extraordinary conjunction of numerical elegance and astronomical fact A system of calendric computation that counts only in twos and threes and which maintains a perfectly triadic order of time-division up to the duration of a two-year period is able to quite easily exceed the performance of the dominant international calendar reaching a level of accuracy that disappears into the inherent instability of the tropical year and is thus strictly speaking unimprovable How many days are there in a year 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 074219 The horror the horror Notes 1 httpwww360calendarcomindexhtm Part 5 From Crimson Paradise to Soft Apocalypse Despite its modernity and decimalism the French calendrier républicain or révolutionnaire had no Year Zero but it re-set the terms of understanding A topic that had been conceived as an intersection of religious commemoration with astronomical fact became overtly ideological and dominated by considerations of secular politics The new calendar which replaced AD 1792 with the first year of the new Era of Liberty lasted for less than 14 years It was formally abolished by Napoléon effective from 1 January 1806 the day after 10 Nivôse an XIV although it was briefly revived during the Paris Commune in AD 1871 or Année 79 de la République when the countrys revolutionary enthusiasm was momentarily re-ignited For the left the calendric re-set meant radical re-foundation and symbolic extirpation of the Ancien Régime For the right it meant immanentization of the eschaton and the origination of totalitarian terror Both definitions were confirmed in 1975 when Year Zero was finally reached in the killing fields of the Kampuchean Khmer Rouge where over a quarter of the countrys population perished during efforts to blank-out the social slate and start over Khmer Rouge leader Saloth Sar better known by his nom de guerre Pol Pot had made Year Zero his own forever re-branded as a South-east Asian final solution Year Zero was henceforth far too corpse-flavored to retain propaganda value but that does not render the calendric equation 1975 0 insignificant rather the opposite Irrespective of its parochialism in time and space corresponding quite strictly to a reincarnation of xenophobic-suicidal national socialism it defines a meaningful epoch as the high-water mark of utopian overreach and the complementary re-valorization of conservative pragmatism Appropriately enough Year Zero describes an instant without duration in which the age of utopian time is terminated in exact coincidence with its inauguration The era it opens is characterized almost perfectly by its renunciation as fantasy social programming extinguishes itself in blood and collapse The immanent eschaton immediately damns itself Historical irony makes this excursion purely sub- academic because the new era is essentially disinclined to conceive itself as such What begins from this Year Zero is a global culture of ideological exhaustion or of common sense acutely sensitive to the grinning deaths head hidden in beautiful dreams and reconciled to compromise with the non-ideal From the perspective of fantastic revolutionary expectation the high-tide of perfectionist vision ebbs into disillusionment and tolerable dissatisfaction but at least it doesnt eat our children The new eras structural modesty of ambition has no time for a radical re-beginning or crimson paradise even when it is historically defined by one Pol Pots Year Zero is sandwiched between the publication of Eric Voegelins The Ecumenic Age 1974 and the first spontaneous Chinese mass protests against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the months following the death of Zhou Enlai in January 1976 It is noteworthy in this regard that Deng Xiaoping eulogized Zhou at his memorial ceremony for being modest and prudent thus the New Aeon speaks In the Anglo-American world the politics of ideological exhaustion were about to take an explicitly conservative form positively expressed as market realism and in this sense deeply resonant with as well as synchronized to Chinese developments Margaret Thatcher assumed leadership of the British Conservative Party in February 1975 and Ronald Reagan declared his presidential candidacy in November of the same year The Englishspeaking left would soon be traumatized by a paradoxical conservative revolution that extracted relentless energy from the very constriction of political possibility What could not happen quickly became the primary social dynamo as articulated by the Thatcherite maxim There is no alternative option zero The auto-immolation of utopia had transmuted into a new beginning Whilst the era of not restarting from zero can be dated to approximate accuracy from AD n 1975 and had thus in fact restarted from zero in profoundly surreptitious fashion its broad consequence was to spread and entrench Gregorian Calendric Dominion ever more widely and deeply The prevailing combination of radically innovative globalization both economic and technological with prudential social conservatism made such an outcome inevitable Symbolic re-commencement wasnt on anybodys agenda and even as the postmodernists declared the end of grand narratives the first planetary-hegemonic narrative structure in history was consolidating its position of uncontested monopoly Globalization was the story of the world with Gregorian dating as its grammar Orphaned by ideological exhaustion stigmatized beyond recovery by its association with the Khmer Rouge and radically maladapted to the reigning spirit of incremental pragmatism by the late 20th century Year Zero was seemingly off the agenda unscheduled and on its own Time then for something truly insidious On January 18 1985 Usenet poster Spencer L Bolles called attention to a disturbing prospect that had driven a friend into insomnia I have a friend that raised an interesting question that I immediately tried to prove wrong He is a programmer and has this notion that when we reach the year 2000 computers will not accept the new date Will the computers assume that it is 1900 or will it even cause a problem I violently opposed this because it seemed so meaningless Computers have entered into existence during this century and has software specifically accounting software been prepared for this turnover If this really comes to pass and my friend is correct what will happen Is it anything to be concerned about Bolles anonymous friend was losing sleep over what would come to be known as the Y2K problem In order to economize on memory in primitive early-generation computers a widely-adopted convention recorded dates by two digits The millennium and century were ignored since it was assumed that software upgrades would have made the problem moot by the time it became imminent close to the rollover of century and millennium in the year AD 2000 Few had anticipated that the comparative conservatism of software legacies relative to hardware development would leave the problem entirely unaddressed even as the crisis date approached In the end Y2K was a non-event that counted for nothing although its preparation costs stimulus effects especially on outsourcing to the emerging Indian software industry and panic potential were all considerable Its importance to the history of the calendar whilst still almost entirely virtual is extremely farreaching Y2K resulted from the accidental or spontaneous emergence of a new calendrical order within the globalized technosphere Its Year Zero 0K 1900 was devoid of all parochial commemoration or ideological intention even as it was propagated through increasingly computerized communication channels to a point of ubiquity that converged asymptotically with that attained by Western Calendric Dominion over the complete sweep of world history The 20th century had been recoded automatically as the 1st century of the Cybernetic Continuum If Y2K had completed its reformatting of the planetary sphere-drive in the way some few deluded hysterics had expected the world would now be approaching the end of the year 0K+111 settled securely in its first arithmetically-competent universal calendar and historically oriented by the same system of electronic computation that had unconsciously decided upon the origin of positive time Instead the millennium bug was fixed and theological date-counting prolonged its dominance uninterrupted after much ado about nothing Most probably the hegemonic cultural complex encrusted in Calendric Dominion never even noticed the cybernetic insurrection it had crushed Between 0K and Y2K the alpha and omega of soft apocalypse there is not only a century of historical time but also an inversion of attitude Time departs 0K as from any point of origin accumulating elapsed duration through its count Y2K in contrast was a destination which time approached as if to an apocalyptic horizon Whilst not registered as a countdown it might easily have been The terminus was precisely determined no less than the origin and the strictest formulation of the millennium bug construed the rollover point as an absolute limit to recordable time beyond which no future was even imaginable For any hypothetical Y2Kconstrained computer intelligence denied access to dating procedures that over-spilled its two-digit year registry residual time shrank towards zero as the millennium event loomed Once all the nines are reached time is finished at the threshold of eternity where beginning and end are indistinguishable in 0 0K its time to wrap this puppy up Revelation 614 Part 6 Countdown At the beginning of the 21st century global cultural hegemony is on the move For roughly 500 years Western and later more specifically Anglophone societies and agencies have predominantly guided the development of the current world system As their economic pre-eminence wanes their cultural and political influence can be expected to undergo a comparable decline In the early stages of the coming transition however the terminal form of active Western cultural hegemony multicultural political correctness MPC is well-positioned to manage the terms of the retreat By reconfiguring basic Western religious and political themes as a systematic sensitization to unwarranted privilege MPC is able to distance itself from its own heritage and to live on in the resentment of the other as if it were the neutral adjudicator of disputes it had no part in When MPC turns its attention to the Gregorian or Western Christian Calendar it is of course appalled But it is also stuck What could be more insensitive to cultural diversity than an ecumenical date-counting system rooted in the ethnic peculiarities of Greek-phase Abrahamic religion which unapologetically celebrates its triumph in the uncompromising words Anno Domini Yet global convergence demands a standard no alternative calendar has superior claims to neutrality and in any case the inertial juggernaut of large-scale complex systems lock-in or pathdependency pose barriers to switching that seem effectively insuperable The solution proposed by MPC to this conundrum is so feeble that it amounts to the completion of Gregorian Calendric Dominion which is to be simultaneously rephrased politely and acknowledged in its irresistible universality as the articulation of a Common Era MPC supplants problems of cultural power with obfuscatory etiquette and in absolute terms its smug dishonesty is difficult to like As a relative phenomenon however its appeal is more obvious since radical solutions to Gregorian Calendric Dominion re-beginning at Year Zero have generally reverted to mass murder Lacking persuasive claims to a new fundamental and universally acknowledged historical break they have substituted terror for true global singularity as if fate could be blotted out in blood Since resentment gets nowhere whether in its mild MPC or harsh killing fields variants it is worth entertaining alternative possibilities These begin with attention to real cultural differences rather than mere cultural diversity as it presents itself to the vacuously MPC-processed mind Soon after Shanghai had been selected as host city for World Expo 2010 in December 2002 countdowns started For Westerners these probably had space-age associations triggering memories of the countdowns to blast off that were popularized by the Apollo Program and subsequent science fiction media It is far from impossible that Chinese shared in these evocations although they were also able to access a far deeper which is to say civilizationally fundamental reservoir of reference That is because Chinese time typically counts down modeled as it is on the workings of water clocks The Chinese language systematically describes previous as above shang and next as beneath xia conforming to an intuition of time as descent Time is counted down as it runs out from an elevated hydraulic body into the sunken future that receives it Duration not only flows it drips Perhaps then an orientalization of calendric perception and organization is something that significantly exceeds a simple or even exceedingly difficult renegotiation of beginnings Re-beginning might be considered largely irrelevant to the problem at least when compared to the re-orientation from an original to a terminal Year Zero Whilst not exactly a transition in the direction of time such a change would involve a transition in the direction of time intuition simultaneously surpassing the wildest ambitions of calendrical reorigination and subtly organizing itself within the pores of the established order of time As modeled by the 2010 Expo and previously by Y2K the switch to countdown time does not frontally challenge or seek to straightforwardly replace the calendric order in being Rather than counting in the same way from a different place it counts in a different way within the framework of time already in place It is a revolution with Chinese characteristics which is to say a surreptitious insurgency changing what something already was rather than replacing it with something else Both the 2010 Expo and Y2K also reveal the extreme difficulty of any such transition since a futural Year Zero or countdown calendar must navigate the arrow of time and its cognitive asymmetry between knowledge of the past and of the future presupposing exact confident and consensual prediction That is why it approximates so closely to conservative acceptance If the countdown is to be sure of arriving at the scheduled terminus the destination event must already be a date rather than an empirical happening Nothing will suffice except a strictly arithmetical rigorously certain inevitability as inescapably predestined as the year 2000 or 2010 which cannot but come From the perspective of the countdown calendar that is what Gregorian Calendric Dominion will have been for It is an opportunity to program an inevitable arrival But when The sheer passage fall of time has assured that the opportunity for calendric revolution presented by the Y2K millennium bug has been irretrievably missed so that AD 1900 0 The same is true of World Expo 2010 an event without pretense to be anything beyond a miniature practice model of global-temporal singularity As for the real techno-commercial Singularity that is an imprecise historical prediction at once controversial and incapable of supporting exact prediction A more appropriate prospect is suggested by the science fiction writer Greg Bear in his novel Queen of Angels set in anticipation of the mid-21st century binary millennium 2048 211 This is a formally suitable purely calendric event deriving its significance from arithmetic rather than ideology or uncertain prophecy He even envisages it as a moment of insurgent revolution when artificial intelligence arises surreptitiously and unnoticed Yet arbitrariness impairs this date why the 11th power of 2 and no serious attempt is made to explain its rise to exceptional cultural prominence If an adjusted global culture is to converge upon a countdown date it must be obvious intrinsically compelling and ideologically uncontroversial in other words spontaneously plausible The target that World Expo 2010 suggests anagrammatically is AD 2100 a date that performs the final stages of a countdown 2 1 0 Reinforcing this indication the Y2K millennium bug threatened to re-set the date of AD 2000 to AD 1900 which would have tacitly reiterated itself at the exact end of the 21st century If it continues to chatter about the calendar perhaps this is how The impending Mayan Apocalypse scheduled for 21 12 2012 offers a preliminary chance to indulge in a festival of countdown numbers like 2010 it looks a lot like another digital singularity simulation If the morning of December 22nd

billion years really seem like such a long time to you It was too late for that question She was no longer in the place where it made sense To forget was a shelter indistinguishable from waking on some paths and manifestation of the outer gates had already been accomplished with excessive harshness Now the rustle of a curtain the tic tic tic of a wind-flustered twig on the window pane relieved her from those hideous cosmic durations which had pulverized all refuge until only raw exposure remained What had been worse were the hatches nested inside each other as they scaled down out of the icy intolerable void Something that was like a wind but was not a wind blasting sucking tugging directly at the mind She scarcely dared to hope that the world had closed again so quietly She rummaged through the corners of each though suspiciously searching for insidiously self-delusive designs Madness is no escape she had told herself or been told advised by a voice that held the keys to indescribable Nightmares No she mumbled the necessary lie as her sleep had before Even in their recession the cruel subtleties impressed her still The slow excruciation had masked itself cunningly spinning a second inaccessible sleep-gate from the fabric of dreams then a third perhaps more each sealed with intricate puzzle-locks Exact recollection fractured among fake awakenings She had thought for long ages that the episodic impossibility of reaching beyond this Matrioshka labyrinth was the whole of her life Crossings beyond crossings Now the palpable menace had dissipated Only its husk remained Vague direness What are you inside Can't sleep Sorry She shifted again Am I keeping you awake It's OK honey Jack Turner's voice had already shrugged off its drowsiness like a dead snake skin He re-angled a pillow to prop himself up against the head-board Something in particular that's bugging you Alison sat up next to him her body stiff with tension Suzy mainly of course She paused momentarily and I guess some other stuff Bad dreams thick with traps and false dawns had been recurrent recently but she wasn't referring to that So you think this Suzy problem is serious Don't you There was querulous edge to the response that she had failed to entirely suppress It wouldn't be Jack who had to deal with this she thought grumpily Still he was asking That was good She took his hand squeezing it slightly She seems OK to me he mumbled Oh Jesus Jack The school has set up some kind of exceptional meeting to discuss what's going on with her Does that sound OK to you So what is He trailed off Neither of them had yet switched on a light The darkness made their exchange seem spectrally insubstantial oneiric You know what honey if we're going to talk this over properly and you're right we should it would be better to get up for a while If we stay here it's just going to feel like insomnia He was already swinging his legs out of bed reaching for his ridiculous tartan dressing gown A glass of wine would help me focus Really She smiled and began roughly mirroring his actions Wine Now At two in the morning When we're both working tomorrow It was meant to sound light but it didn't Moonlight painted black webs over her face She scanned the dimness for her favorite night-dress an over-sized tattered jumper that had once been maroon but was now an odd shade of bruised gray The left elbow was completely gone but it was warm the weight and scratchiness comforting Locating the shadowy mound near the curtain she hooked it towards her with one foot and pulled it on To give up on sleep like this was a relief It was true 02 Jack had already fished a half-consumed bottle of Shiraz from the fridge by the time she reached the kitchen She sat at their large timescoured table and let him pour her a glass I'm seeing Suzy's teacher tomorrow straight after work she said There's not much to discuss until then Do you know what it's about Frightening her classmates That's all I've been told Frightening them That's all I've been told she repeated lengthening the leash on her irritation OK OK He held up his hands defensively It's just absurd Yes She sighed I've been dealing with this for almost a week By dinnertime tomorrow we'll know what it's all about But it's keeping you up he persisted Oh I don't know Jack It was her turn to throw up her hands almost knocking her wine glass over It's not a rational thing She'll be OK he mused vaguely swirling his unconsumed wine into a slow vortex mind caught in the red swirl Although actually since we're here there is one Suzy-related matter that concerns me a little That stupid game she predicted He looked up surprised Yes that's right Feels like it ate our daughter sometimes doesn't it A ghostly smile They'd never spoken about it before as far as he could remember Not even casually in micro-fragments or humorous allusions It was odd perhaps slightly sinister for this prominent time-wedge driven diagonally into their family to have become so entirely unmentionable The thing that's been bugging me is that we don't know anything about it Driving home the other night I tried to calculate how much time she's spent in there A thousand hours It can't be less than that It's not that I want to go down the young people today road but we know nothing at all about their lives She was sure this completion of his sentence wouldn't count as an interruption He'd let it hang half-way long enough to offer an invitation The pseudo-telepathy was a little marital solidarity on the cheap They probably needed that right now There was a roughness rolling in from somewhere It was going to be hard She shivered slightly He was tilted towards her attentively and noticed Cold Metaphysically cold She smiled weakly but genuinely to take the edge off the verbal chill You know that old TV thing Winter's coming Now you're being melodramatic although he didn't really think so It won't seem like anything much looking back 03 It was already winter and the darkness was slow to ebb Through the unveiled kitchen window they could see across the street which was patchily illuminated by sparse suburban street lighting cold bluish neon feeding shadows A random speckling of warmer night lights dotted the houses opposite Roofs were dusted with early snow catching the luminosity of Earth's dead satellite which hung huge and low in a purpleblack sky Hunter's moon Jack thought without great confidence It was a term he knew only from fictions Horror stories And how about the other stuff he asked after a while So he'd heard and remembered She was impressed Work oddness I'm not sure if it's anything really She no longer thought she wanted to return there If it's keeping you awake it has to be something There was no escaping it Perhaps it would be good to talk it over although that now seemed unlikely There's a case it's getting to me somehow I don't know why At least I don't think I know Which wasn't true or even a sustainable lie An especially creepy cult No nothing like that I mean sure it's creepy in its own way And that way would be It's almost too how should I put it too calm too rational too civilized I'm sorry Jack this is stupid isn't it He ignored the evasive self-deprecation So what's the beliefsystem Technically it's a Makharov Type-IX cosmo-deist inversion fatalistic pessimistic apocalyptic If I were a collector this would be my prize specimen It's near-perfect Except they're too nice He'd been well-primed That was exactly what it was at least part of it She released an odd bubble of laughter then shook her head as if to clear it No coercion no isolation no real economic exaction sure there's charismatic leadership but here's the weirdest part I met her The leader Yes in a coffee shop of all things Stranger still it was my client who insisted on it introduced us It was ethically I didn't know what to think I still don't She was charming polite clearly highly-intelligent My client obviously likes and respects her It's nuts So what's the problem He's scared But I thought No not of her or the group He's scared of the philosophy of his own beliefs There's nothing to stop him walking away but he can't walk away from himself He wants not to have thought certain things Can you help with that he asked skeptically Smart Jack she thought you get it She shrugged I've tried to explain what the therapy can do and what it can't that the only difficulties we're able to deal with are those of dependency He even seems to understand it If there was someone else he could turn to he probably would But where does he go A priest of some kind would be the obvious answer but the only sense in which he's religious is this one and it's the source of the problem He can't philosophize his way out that's why he came to me in the first place She scowled in frustration You'd be at least as useful to him as I am more I'd guess your interests are closer to the topic What is the topic I'm finding it hard to help him she said obliquely No it's worse than that I dig him deeper into it Into what It took a struggle to keep the frustration out of his voice The End is a Thing and an Intelligence that's what they say And we can converse with it This thing has a name The color drained from her face suddenly Allie He reached across the table to grasp her hand It was clammy abnormally cold Allie what the hell is it She jolted back as if from somewhere else The ghastly parody of a smile struggled onto her lips It's nothing I'm sure it's nothing Really For Christ's sake Allie you're scaring me to death What is it The name Oh Jack I know it sounds stupid but I'm having a really bad time with the name This is about Suzy too somehow isn't it He had no idea how he knew She nodded minutely brokenly Don't laugh Jack but the connection is Suzy's ridiculous invisible friend Phil he recalled immediately It was a phase that had lasted longer than the time since its end Yes it started with that hideous stuffed octopus remember Bob and Sally bought it for her which I'll never forgive them for and she refused to let us throw it out even after it had disintegrated into shreds It got absolutely disgusting and then when I put it in the washing machine it clogged up the filter She paused unnaturally frozen as if a wave of entrancement had passed through her and then resumed without any sign she had noticed the interruption those gray-green threads of some indescribable material Then Suzy would be mad Why was I trying to ruin her cottopos What did I have against Phil You remember Sure It went on for years And then when we finally got the filthy zone out cottopos into the trash it was still I don't believe you Phil told me that's nonsense Phil knows much more about that than you do Phil tells me different Phil tells me secrets Something had happened to her voice that chilled him to the bone marrow Yes Why did she call him Phil Her gaze was black ice I don't Why Why that name It came out of nowhere didn't it He struggled through mental fog towards some clear recollection Nothing came It was just a random thing I guess Random What's this about Allie I'm not understanding at all what this is about Maybe it's nothing I think we're way beyond that point She laid her hands flat on the table took several deep breaths started over Cult extraction therapy is a slow spiral inwards towards the central beliefs Her voice had slowed too stripped of inflection as if she was reading from a manual It was a distancing tactic This was how she put difficult material in order He remembered her sounding this way as she enumerated the options available to them when Suzy had broken her ankle on the slopes of Mount Lovell six hours hiking distance from civilization It had been OK that time in the end It's important not to start with matters of doctrine or get to them too quickly The cult experience has to be cognitively neutralized You start with the social dynamics then the rituals The beliefs come last So it wasn't until we were deep into the process that I first heard it It being The name Suzy's invisible friend name The intonation was identical like an old recording being played back just for me Jack it was horrible It sounded the same exactly the same but I heard it differently as if this time I was hearing what it truly said what it was I've never been so Inertia would have led her to say scared but she stopped because that wasn't it It had been much closer to grief although it wasn't that either It had been the impossibility of continuing to live suddenly understood but in a way that was not at all personal Everything was impossible that's what it meant Everything was over There was a revolution slow and implacable like the wheeling of the galaxies in which even the incandescence of the stars was a concentration of coldness Icy necessity she murmured reluctantly remembering It was the name of fate This isn't making any sense is it Her eyes were clogged with emptiness Where reflection should have been there was only the soulscouring vacuity of some abandoned and then long-desolated hell 04 Some nights seem not to end except inside themselves They are filled with strange turns leading to unwanted doors Sleep is supposed to protect us from them Jack glanced at his watch which wasn't there Panicked now by an obscurity far beyond his tolerance he rushed into an imbecile buffoonery The humiliation was pitched up into agony even as it rolled out but he was unable to stop himself Phil Their ominous cosmic thing is called Phil You mean like Philip the Magnificent Destroyer of Worlds Rising up immediately behind the infantile giggle that then sought to emerge was a dilating bubble of hysteria without obvious conclusion Theories of cosmic expansion modeled it mathematically A dilation not in but of space Inflationary catastrophe so extreme it can be mistaken for the beginning of the universe He still remembered with sharp clarity the moment as a 15-year-old when he had first truly understood that grasped what it meant what it said that space was right here Cosmology had possessed him then Now he locked the virtual explosion behind a rigid broken grin Alison's expression was unforgiving No I don't mean anything like that At all she said stonily Chastened he swallowed the last of his wine poured some more This moment of idiocy would haunt him for the rest of his life he realized sourly The need for psychological insulation was now an explicit urgent demand So it's another Phil Her gaze softened to become strangely pitying as her voice dropped almost to a whisper You're still thinking it all upside down He had begun to see something that he didn't want to see to a terrifying level of resolution It was still no more than the shadow of a thought but its contours were acutely defined Upside down yes There was a cognitive rotation he could sense it precisely like the dial on a safe If twisted around it would free the thought to come forth from out of the dark and it would bring the dark with it It would unquestionably be too much to bear She has to carry this for now he thought or they would both be finished At the lucid acknowledgement of this despicable cowardice self-loathing blossomed like a tropical flower vivid in its captivating accusation Still it had to be her It simply had to She had passed already over the threshold That was unmistakable There would be no point in him joining her there not yet If he did there would be nothing further he could do His mind writhed in a hasty search for some more ego-compatible rationalization That was good The futile puzzle was a distraction It was something else Perhaps she even understood that she couldn't let him know So what do you think it means he pretended to ask Don't ask me that It wasn't quite a shriek but something was welling up that wanted to be one If there could be nothing but noise without sense it would help She wasn't prepared to drown alone sinking endlessly into some ocean trench of truth to spare a rescuer who would never arrive in time for anyone Instead she clung to his disintegrating raft of evasion hands gripping the side of the table veins and tendons outlined like hieroglyphics of stress You don't get to hog the shelter of self-deception all to yourself goddammit He forgot sometimes that she was a psychologist by training and inclination They stared at each other more distanced than they had ever been and yet simultaneously complicit in a deliberate desperate unknowing The congealing lie nestled between them was scarcely less real than a second child 05 The client had understood That was a discovery beyond all plausible uncertainty now Wherever they were being drawn it was a place that he had been from which he could not exit He had reached out to Alison in a desperate search for untruth She had been useless to him and merely professional not knowing enough to be serious Now it had come to this He had called it TotAL and conversationally of course simply Total the Temple of the Absolute Limitation it had other names but that was the one they had used during counselling This compact semiotic bundle was packed with occult clues which she could have followed if doctrine and cultural genealogy had been the subject of interest but they weren't She wasn't trying to be serious about this strange little cult but rather the opposite for what had seemed perfectly good reasons It had been all-too successful at being taken seriously certainly as far as her client was concerned or so it had seemed to her then What had been needed then was something else As in totalitarian she had asked him It had been intended as a light joke and not all as a manipulative psycho-social prompt That had been clear from her tone she'd thoughtlessly assumed but he had reacted with awkward distress She felt bad about it at once Before he had even finished stammering a denial she hushed him with an apology Looking back that clumsy jest came to seem like a moment of disastrous breakage The key to the therapy in her experience had always been bound to humor There was a critical point of rupture at which the client was induced to laugh at the cult's mental chains As the bonds of belief came to seem ridiculous they fell away That was the way out It was a reliable route the only one she knew but on this occasion it had been lost recoverably sacrificed to a failed witticism The comedy was over Somewhere off-stage TotAL thickened condensed in vindication The therapeutic process was still underway as a vacant formality but it was limping nowhere For the client we can call him Simon though this was not of course his real name it was as if the final door had been slammed shut He slumped back in his chair struggling to dull the barbs of reproach which were in any case rendered irrelevant by the ceremony of unconditional surrender to the oppression of his own intelligence No assistance would ever come How could he ever have imagined it might The Temple asks nothing of me he said softly It told me something when I asked it to That's all It told you communication with the end of the universe was possible That sounds absurd because it's badly formulated So formulate it better This was no longer extraction therapy or anything like it This was contagion We exist within a stream of signs a torrent Information flows through us in overwhelming abundance as a deluge It is screened sieved filtered and edited trimmed narrativized delegated to mental sub-systems dumped so as not to drown us Yet if we can calm ourselves enough to think it is clear that this flood of signal can have only one possible source reality Reality So what is reality That's the question yes Don't you see It's telling you It's The Flood It's total revelation Every second it pours in through hundreds thousands of channels Don't ask for a sign I'm quoting Phyllis now Perhaps I have been for a while You have a billion signs a minute that you don't want You're already in The Flood Phyllis Alison muttered with an irrepressible hint of bitterness Of course You've read Ovid Alison strained to remember to catch the reference Nothing came The abandoned princess I gave many gifts many that I was given but you false Demophon fled You blocked it out forgot shielded yourself with distance You left me You're confusing me Yes it's too much I'm sorry He closed his eyes resigned You didn't ask for this 06 Alison Turner disliked Clifford Bagley within seconds of meeting him It was not his fault she recognized Unfortunately his manner recalled someone else someone for whom she had felt intense aversion and had in fact quite obsessively hated The personal characteristics in question were not intrinsically loathsome this admission took some psychological effort They were no worse than neutral although not less than pitiable Signs of a barely-controlled anguish A neurotic agitation of the hands A darting shiftiness of expression A chronic apologetic cringe that veiled like orbital dust a hidden core of unfathomable gravity-locked rage It was an absolute defeatedness perversely triumphant and held at bay by some tortured parody of normality as a kind of undeath They had called the previous man Zombie A nervous adolescent giggle threatened to revive at the thought Poor Mr Bagley was probably a Zombie too It bonded the two men across time and space with the absolute necessity due some shared Platonic essence The other man whose name still escaped her had also been a teacher and the man she had most detested during the entire course of her life to date This was not based upon anything specific that he had done It was a response to his overall attitude which had been directed she felt at the time towards her absolute psychological annihilation There was a way he had of speaking to her seemingly without the slightest hint of deliberate malignancy which reduced her immediately to nothing That at least was the story she had told herself throughout two decades of adult life but now for no reason she could quickly identify she felt this narrative slipping There had been something else Something more intrinsically obscure Perhaps something much worse None of this need have been relevant were it not for the fact that civil interaction with Mr Bagley was going to be important He was Suzy's class teacher and quite probably a perfectly unobjectionable individual The topic of discussion however was going to be fraught with tension Bagley's mysterious inner unity with his vile precursor would be a further hurdle to be cleared Yet it began well He removed his smart watch and placed it carefully in the desk drawer The action was a little fussy but it was undoubtedly considerate Alison wondered vaguely whether he was following an institutional procedure or a private one In either case she appreciated it In her own work it was even more important to project focus She had no watch at all but only a micro-tablet It was flexible enough to run her life through yet easily stowed in her shoulder-bag Susie would roll her eyes at the archaism on occasions sorry you were saying Focus Could he have said that No that was from her own chain of thinking But he had said something hadn't he Are you alright Ms Turner His concern was understandable The dark rings under her eyes had to be brutal I'm not at all sure what this is about she stated flatly determined to keep the defensiveness from her voice This is an unusual meeting isn't it Yes Yes it is he concurred over-eagerly It's about Susan of course He had picked up a pencil and was twisting it awkwardly between his fingers He was not enjoying this It's that well she's upsetting the other children he blurted out I'm hoping you can help me understand why For a few seconds Alison was actually stunned She was surprised and then because her surprise made no real sense thrown into confusion by her own unpreparedness She had relapsed somehow What had she been expecting after all Wasn't it exactly this Worse than this She could no longer remember Upsetting she managed finally Upsetting them how It's actually quite complicated Bagley replied quickly assertion and apology messily tangled in his tone If it wasn't we could have perhaps done this over the phone His face underwent a subtle convulsion as it lurched towards a smile and then after urgent consideration retreated back towards sympathetic gravitas She's only eleven It was pointless clumsy fencing As if she had some use for time To be blunt that is exactly the point Eleven-year-old kids don't talk about these type of things not in my experience at least What type of things I'm sorry but this is all in code I really have no idea what you're talking about He ran his hands through his thinning hair and sighed Actually I'm not really sure I've tried to get Susan to explain her ideas to me many times now but they can be hard to follow She's frighteningly bright he winced noticeably at the adjective Her mind is fast and I'd say perhaps daring venturing into areas few want to follow or can follow What little I understand it mostly comes from her classmates and they're usually confused often upset Sometimes very upset Without warning he changed tack I have to ask Do you talk about religion much at home I know that your work She interrupted rudely her fury barely contained My work has nothing to do with it Then with a forced brittle calm I'm very careful to insulate Susan from my work I'd never dream of mentioning my cases to her She's a child and I do understand what that means My case files never enter the house My computer is securely locked Nothing I come across at work has anything to do with this Nothing But she knows what you do Why are you asking this Her naked hostility had driven him even further into cryptic allusion Some of the ah themes of her thinking they're how can I put this most unlikely to have reached her any other way Your daughter has some very complicated very unusual ideas of a religious nature We had to suspect I think I know where she got these ideas Alison said quietly defeated by a flash of insight The answer to this horrible riddle loomed into view clad in the unmistakable livery of parental neglect Guilt had now crystallized and become unprojectable She's very deeply involved in a game A game Bagley ruminated aloud relieved by the ebb of tension and struggling to convince himself of the new storyline but it was impossible It's an um interesting suggestion Then with evident reluctance The trouble is the system of belief we're talking about seems to be far too sophisticated for that You still haven't told me very much Alison replied meekly all fight gone Everything starts from the end I beg your pardon The words had escaped too soon The last thing she wanted was an explanation but Bagley was already providing one It's something Suzy said Not to me directly but to the other children Often it seems And there was a poem she wrote with that title for Mr Foster her English teacher It wouldn't have been a problem of course not at all if it wasn't part of something more Something she was able to communicate to her classmates with um consequences He's scared too Alison thought to block out a wave of other thoughts which could be made to wait There were too many connections to cope with now They would have to be shelved dealt with later somewhere else Jack would have to share this There was an attempted suicide Bagley continued cheeks reddening eyes wandering desperately He couldn't look at her Christ The child survived he added quickly and unnecessarily No lasting physical damage but I'm sure you understand The parents are incensed Legal action has been threatened It's not the sort of thing the school can simply overlook Her mind recoiled from situation stumbling backwards into the hideous other Bagley's prototype what had been his name The question gnawed at her distractingly She had always known it surely and then suddenly it was there Filkin George Filkin but the forename added nothing Are you feeling alright Mrs Turner I'm so sorry but I feel sick she said stinging pin-pricks swirling across her temples like particles of ice Is there a bathroom He pointed and she ran hand cupped over her mouth down the corridor to the pink and blue gender signage She skidded inside reaching the bowl just in time It smelt of disinfectant primarily then of children before anything worse She vomited everything out in three increasingly-painful spasms The cool of the porcelain against her cheek offered an iota of compensatory bliss Consciousness receded into dot pattern and a continuous whine then slithered back clogged with self-disgust Now he'll think I'm on drugs she thought miserably 07 So the game was on They waited until Suzy disappeared upstairs to bed then squatted down together beside the terminal The neat set of little matt black boxes leads and attachments was such a familiar feature of the room that it had long edited itself out of attention but they noticed it now It was an unintelligible alien incursion and a door There's some material I printed off the Web Alison said It's kind of what you'd expect except when you dig a little deeper it's not She extracted a thick sheaf of A4 pages from her bag The archaic substantiality was comforting in its determinacy and finitude Some passages had been marked up in red ball-point pen The word that comes up a lot is creative she continued After a while I began to wonder what that really meant It's complicated and not only for the obvious reasons Maybe we should start with the obvious reasons said Jack uncertainly There's no time Actually I don't think there's time for any of this We just need to hack in there and find out what's going on Hack in His doubts had redoubled That might not be easy I broke into her watch Alison said pride and shame reciprocally neutralized You did I watched her needling the password in and could see it was a nine-letter code Eventually I found it written down in a notebook badly hidden in a paragraph of scrambled text Phylsword What She wrote it down for him Phyl sword I'd thought Phyl's word but who knows And in the phone find anything He tried to keep the tone nonjudgmental No Nothing she admitted Not even sure what I was looking for Something to do with the damn game Keys He activated the console It took only a second to power-up We'll need a username and a password Two nine-figure codes this time by the look of it He was pretending to think it was possible for no real reason but the act was evidently unconvincing You don't believe we can do this do you Weariness outweighed accusation Eighteen bytes of security isn't a joke Maybe she uses Phyl's word again Then it's just 72 bits You know that story about grains of rice and a chessboard She ignored the reference Suzy turns He shrugged tried it Username and password do not match This isn't the way Allie There are over one hundred trillion combinations and that's just the alphanumerics We don't have a serious method for shrinking the search space Suzy's old enough and smart enough to keep secrets from us Three fails in a row and I expect it to lock us out while flagging an attempted intrusion We're wasting our time The message got through then and Alison doubled-back The chessboard thing she mumbled Yes I get it Suzy's brain has escaped Years ago actually So what's the next move Suzy opens it up for us what else could it be You think she would Better than one-in-a-trillion chance and we're still ahead It was nearly midnight Steps coming down the stairs Guiltily they re-positioned themselves away from the machine Suzy opened the door What on earth are you doing up young lady Alison asked activating a deeply-grooved formula Weird dream Suzy replied her voice slurred with tiredness I wanted a drink of milk It wasn't clear whether she was even awake As Alison steered their daughter into the kitchen Jack lay back on the rug closing his eyes Walls of closed code spooled down across selfstimulating retinas in random flurries Winter was whispering outside 08 There wasn't much milk in the fridge Order had drifted Alison estimated the contents of the carton dubiously Maybe somebody could restock before breakfast in the morning She poured what there was into a glass and handed it to Suzy This dream It wasn't a nightmare Really Alison countered skeptically recalling her own recent lies She noticed her daughter's thin pajamas and bare feet You must be freezing Jack had left one of his heavy winter jumpers dangling messily over the back of a chair thoughtlessly abandoned an arm inside out Here put this on She should have been rushing Suzy back to bed but there were things that she wanted to know It was more of a puzzle Suzy volunteered Umm what's the word abstract There was a shape but it didn't make sense as if it didn't fit into space and it had a direction a tilt I don't know how You were in it too and Dad trying to work something out There were so many signs buried inside each other It raced my brain too fast and I woke up OK honey She couldn't help hoping for more Suzy finished her milk and started to get up then sat down again Something's going to happen isn't it Is it Alison had already switched I don't know something's always happening She didn't want this conversation anymore It's really late You've got school tomorrow You know the weirdest part of the dream Mom Of course she didn't Please let that be true She shook her head but the negations were tripping over each other getting confused There was a stage close to the end that somehow wasn't my dream at all It got tangled up with this house or another like it in a way but not quite with corridors and halls and connections I remember thinking I've wandered into Mom and Dad's room Even there in the dream I knew what it was saying I'd taken some strange turnings in the dark and crossed into a dream you were supposed to be having Not that it was yours either not really It was its own place I thought Dad's good at geometry he'll be able to explain it but you'd been there more somehow so you'd be particularly familiar Then I was awake without noticing and felt thirsty It wasn't really scary but it was odd Honestly Suzy you're the most peculiar little person sometimes She didn't know whether to laugh weep or shudder She looked at her watch theatrically We definitely have to get you to bed 09 Galaxies are not scarce There are at least one hundred billion in the universe with each containing roughly one hundred billion stars That's 10000000000000000000000 or ten sextillion stars altogether perhaps many more It's an unintelligible number and then an awe-striking one and then a horror story This non-fictional horror story is very special It has a name that owes nothing to the flights of literary imagination This is science's own soberly-delineated nightmare It is called The Great Filter As scientifically-disciplined inquisitiveness pulls life apart into chemistry its mysteries are alchemized into an astounding normality Life requires nothing very extraordinary for its existence Its known replicator molecules are not devoid of intricacy but they are simple enough for earth's dominant mammals to have reconstructed while still unaided by thinking machines Sheer cosmic noise of which there is of course plenty suffices as a source of variation The natural selection mechanism that sifts through trillions of copies extracting and propagating the most functional variants is a pure and indeed utterly inescapable automatism Chemical stock is abundant suitable thermic conditions common Nothing obvious stands in life's way According to the ever-more insistent suggestion of mainstream scientific intelligence the universe should be teeming Really it should All available general evidence points to a galaxy pulsing with life The specific evidence therefore is chilling For none is to be found beyond our own solitary case What do we know about the Great Filter really We have a name for it if only a provisional one which says something It has acknowledged existence In the terms of the philosophers it is rigidly designated Something there is of which we know nothing except that it efficiently exterminates all advanced civilizations at a cosmic scale We're still around for now Turner thought settling back into the absurdly comfortable chair Alex offered favored guests to his office Drink Turner pulled-up the time on his watch it wasn't yet 4pm He raised an eyebrow Don't be such a goddamned Puritan Jack it's been a long day For you too I can see It will grease the synapses He was already pouring one for himself with exaggerated appreciation It's a truly excellent single malt My God perhaps the universe does have a purpose Go on then you degenerate Turner laughed As if I can say no to that Alex reached under his desk for a second tumbler Cigar I thought that was strictly against the rules Special dispensation didn't you know Got it written into the employment contract Anyway no thanks nicotine jolts me around too much Mind if I do Alex asked with apparent sincerity opening a matt-silver cylinder to release what had to be north of thirty bucks-worth of hand-rolled fragrant tobacco leaf Of course not So you're back on the Filter nonsense Only as a minor side-line Still Curious whether there'd been any developments I've missed All the fiddly standard candle calibration stuff has been distracting me from the speculative cosmology discussion recently Developments holy shit you're serious aren't you I think I might have a link to some website you'd find helpful tracking down the connections between unusual levels of yeti activity and Area-51 A phone trilled Sorry Jack I have to take this Don't go anywhere He spun his chair around to face the landscaped campus panorama of autumnal copses and lakeside lawns encapsulating himself in a wireless bubble as he clicked down the mic from his headset Yes this is Professor Scott Yes I've been expecting your call We're good to go A couple of proposed budget revisions they've already been forwarded to you The deadline's OK as long as we get everything we need Great That's great Sure let's do it Great Yes Superb Catch you at the convention Brian Gotta go Click With the Deep Space Systems Nanowave Modulator contract confirmed he swiveled back undistracted thread unbroken but it's worse than that isn't it Jack It's philosophy I mean holy fucking shit didn't the last beating you took from me do you any good at all The Great Filter is empirically inferred Turner insisted stubbornly It's not even conceptually-dependent upon the Anthropic Principle Woooh boy Scott was enjoying himself Empirically inferred I love that Truly and woodily Trouble is Jack when you run through all the catastrophe scenarios you find that none of them hang together AI catastrophe doesn't work you know that Killer machines of any kind are just more hidden aliens Simulation traps can't complete the probability calculus and in fact nothing plausible can Get to the end of the list and poof no space yetis Turner was stunned into silence His mouth actually fell open idiotically After a few seconds however Scott's smile of complacent triumph provoked him into a response Sorry Alex but that's absurd he mumbled almost inaudibly unsure how to restore his argumentative bearings What would even count as a logical step forward at this point If Scott could rest his mind so comfortably upon reasoning from mere utilitarian convenience were there any real limits on his thinking at all Why would we even begin to believe that we can comprehensively enumerate how things could go bad It was too late For Scott the exchange was already over Turner could see the disengagement happening Scott's gaze wandering a sluggish indifference creeping into his voice You're telling me we should be terrified of something we can't even imagine Terrified I don't know but basically yes that's exactly what I'm telling you Come on Jack listen to yourself That isn't science I don't know what it is statistical heebie-jeebies of some kind It reminds me of that demented Doomsday Argument Another monster conjured up out of the unknown by unconstrained probabilistic reasoning At a certain point you just have to be sensible and by that I mean minimally sane like there are no fucking space yetis sane If it's unthinkable it's not a problem right It's no more than a bad dream You shake the philosophical cobwebs out of your head and get over it It had been a pleasure as always 10 Alison glanced at her watch There were several specks in the queue She delegated them to the embedded secretary with a few habit-honed needle taps It was Friday night getting late and professional responsibilities were on hold All that mattered now was the time Where the hell is Suzy she grumbled irritably It's past ten Carol warned us about the length of the movie Jack replied soothingly It could be another 15 minutes Then seizing the opportunity So this Filkin guy the zombie what happened to him He killed himself she replied flatly I didn't care at all either way It was an ending So you've no idea why Come on Jack she almost laughed No idea You know how many lunatic ideas get served up to me every day I'm up to my nostrils in ideas Ideas are fucking pollution There are always ideas OK OK He was smiling too Seemed like a loose end in the story somehow I guess not She had wandered over to the window reflection buried in the dark Sporadic snow-muffled traffic noises drifted in The stars were like ice crystals as the poets had always said The stilled year waited for nothing in particular Occasional flakes meandered downwards to expire upon the glass It's madness isn't it she said To think that his name and the source of his death could have any connection I'd never imagined insanity could be so cold There's chance he tried You were gambling on worse than trillion-to-one odds yesterday That's because I didn't understand The door buzzed Once Suzy was inside Carol thanked the door closed the car's Doppler-shifted vanishing complete negotiations proceeded rapidly There was only one item on the agenda and Suzy grasped it almost immediately Go in without me and you'll be dead in ten minutes Go in with my carrier and you'll trash it So I'd have to guide you Would you Alison asked before Jack could complicate the proposal Suzy's ambivalence was palpable a jagged oscillation between compliance and resistance This isn't going to go away is it she asked eventually No it isn't Alison replied firmly Suzy had been protected from the details of the school consultation but she understood enough to realize that it hadn't gone well I don't know what you expect she said with a hint of petulance What should we expect Darkness Pain more calmly factual than Gothic Well if that's to be the discovery maybe you shouldn't be spending half your life in there The soliton of controlled anger was not well hidden Jack placed his hand on Alison's knee the message economically conveyed we need her cooperation Suzy noticed and pretended not to You tried to break in didn't you Yes Unhesitatingly It didn't really matter how she knew or what she thought of it If it appeared as a sign of clumsy desperation that might help Alright then You'll do it I said alright When She re-angled her wrist to glance at the time Username Suzyxwvut she said Password phylundhu 11 Looking around in this strange space Jack realized just how definite his quickly-extinguished expectations had been The word game had been bound in his mind to tacit convictions that already seemed laughably false Through sheer inertia a failure to update he would once have said earnestly he'd been prepared for an environment that announced its artificiality through limited resolution Even were it not discernibly pixelated it would be somehow cartoonish and sensually shallow The discrepancy was shocking He concentrated his attention on the gray horizon struggling to collapse its depth into the graininess of electronic illusion Clouds coiled heavily around distant peaks A storm was coming His genre assumptions had been no less inaccurate Suzy had never spoken about it much she'd simply disappeared into it There had been packaging at one stage though and perhaps some kind of illustrated booklet From those an impression had assembled itself automatically grafted onto a mnemonic backdrop of legends fairytales and childhood fantasies He had anticipated an elaborate stage-set designed for chivalric romance It wasn't like that Everything was wrong or almost everything scales styles atmospherics In its expanses as in its details there seemed too much of it to be for anything There was a jagged harshness here that no story could soften Neither Allie nor Suzy looked much like themselves but he recognized both of them immediately Age differences had been compressed but only moderately They were still two parents with their child The adjustments to their features were subtler still although weatherings hardenings and scarrings now suggested a familiarity with extremes of endurance and casual cruelty Alison had the posture and expression of a stone-cold killer Compared to Suzy she was a picture of humanitarian sensitivity He and Alison were dressed in utilitarian black clothing frayed and stained designed for walking through rugged terrain and well-adapted to the climate Various clips belts and pouches were conveniently provided for collecting stuff It was a game after all Suzy's attire echoed there's stylistically but it had been modified by long years of adaptation Her utility slots were neatly cluttered with items and implements of obscure provenance and purpose systematically scavenged from various distant corners of this cryptic world The predominant ashy black coloration of her clothing was disrupted by irregular stripes of vivid green They were wasp markings evidently She had become venomous enough here to post a warning They stood on a ridge high enough to be cool but the landscape around and beneath them was densely jungled steamy and voracious Tropical vegetation gnawed at a fractured terrain of slippages and chasms Scattered throughout the scene were untidy jumbles of human habitation bursting from the tangled foliage like ulcerations What do you think It's so The thought had not completed itself but it was heading through grim and melancholic towards crushingly oppressive or worse It's beautiful isn't it Suzy anticipated with eager inaccuracy Bigger than the world somehow Something massive towered behind them At first he mistook it for a mountain perhaps an extinct volcano It tapered to a summit lost among clouds Only gradually did the realization dawn that this was an artificial structure His mind reeled at the impossibility Then he remembered where he was Ashenzohn Suzy said It's old Old He didn't want this His mind recoiled exhausted and shuddering Already psychologically bruised from spatial super-saturation he had not begun to consider the time-dimension also opening into shattering expanses Of course it was going to have been sensational but somehow he had not been ready for it and it was all far too much He shut his eyes but the sucking vastness still impinged Where a headache should have been there was instead a kind of tumbling outwards a vacuuming away of self The colossal mound however screwed monstrously into the sullen sky was something he understood It had to be That now was inescapably obvious I know what it is he said It's a space elevator or what's left of one The ruins of a terrestrial base station Suzy was looking at him fixedly her face illuminated by something close to awe How did you know A story He struggled for recollection It was by a writer called let me think yes Reynolds Very similar structure a massive spiral Time itself decayed regressed as you descended it The setting was more arid if I'm remembering right He was rambling and stopped himself Books he teased Did you ever come across them There's a library she retorted acidly A big one Maybe you'd like to see it Where She pointed along the spur to the root where it fused into the mega-structure A large domed edifice nestled there pale gray against the cluttered inky backdrop of the spike The lighter building She nodded How far is that The scales were still disconcerting She pursed her lips pondering We could probably get there in an hour I suppose An hour Alison grumbled You have to stop fretting about time Mom Suzy scolded gently It doesn't work like that here You mean Jack began as an unseen door began to creak open on the far-side of his mind Don't ask Alison interjected fiercely He wasn't going to saunter into that hurricane especially trusting his curiosity as little as he currently did Alison had more than earned her present position as the warden of secrets If she thought there was something they didn't want to meet lurking at the end of that question it would be madness to second-guess her Still Mental gears had begun to grind and they refused to return to rest Some kind of time dilation which had to mean they were thinking in the machine accelerated beyond themselves It inclined to an alternative interpretation of the Reynolds structure whose time gyres were differentiated by refinements of matter Could the levels of the cyclopean screw correspond to echelons of duration Great mechanical twists of inwardness It was odd to be noticing it only now Why had he never made the connection before After Susie had consumed the instruction manual she had been absorbed in it for weeks as if lost in a religious tract of unfathomable significance it had been left lying around crumpled the inner pages coming unstapled and he had definitely registered it deliberately consciously attentive The structure was depicted starkly its spiral groove unambiguously marked yet it had somehow eluded him This might be it you know he thought aloud What might be what Alison asked It's one of the Filter theories Absorption into simulations Cultures swirling out of the universe like dirty water down a plug Derealization vortices 12 Alison was not seeing a virtual mega-construct from a science fiction novel but rather the Tower of Babel The elder Marten van Valckenborch's painting of 1595 had captured it best with its hint of spiral torsion amid doomed industry as the incarnated project ascended into darkness The Dutch Renaissance spoke to her in a way she had never seriously reflected upon and a large print of this work a personal favorite graced the wall of her office Perhaps she had hoped that its depiction of extravagant enterprise twisted about an occult core of invisible insanity as it wound upwards to collapse would find echoes among the tortured systemsbuilders with whom she professionally conversed brought onto her client list by comparably ruinous cravings for the absolute It had taken a while before she realized that no small number of her clients were soaking up the image as keenly as she had done and were finding something very different in it Simon had been lucidly forthcoming on the subject as on so many other things He had made no attempt to disguise his fascination On their very first meeting when she ushered him to the comfortable chair that served as an analytical or therapeutic couch he had strayed instead over to the wall where the picture hung Not only was the work familiar to him he had made very deliberate efforts to see the original in Dresden cataloguing the experience as among the most memorable of his life When he saw it though then and now he also saw through it The name he gave it said everything It was simply the Evil Tower Evil she had queried skeptically It struck her as an atypically vulgar description Don't get me wrong he added quickly It isn't a judgment about the phenomenon it's the judgment inherent in the phenomenon Nemesis The demonstrated judgment Second-guessing the lesson is the sin Now she was here in the shadow of the broken tower its eclipsing vastness palpable upon her skin Alison wriggled out of her backpack and rummaged through it There wasn't much inside A few pieces of clothing an aluminum water bottle some light simple tools The most substantial object was a crude blade attached securely to the side of the pack by crisscrossed straps It was a kind of machete not especially sharp its cutting edge besmirched with brown stains Am I really going to need this she muttered disgustedly under her breath Unlikely Suzy replied Thank goodness for small mercies Or thank something else for this Suzy extracted a compact matt-black weapon from a fold in her tunic and held it up for them to admire Can I look at that Jack asked his voice stretched wolfishly Sure Suzy said scanning their immediate environment with trained efficiency then handing the killing tool over It was the size of a small machine-pistol almost square with a flattened barrel culminating in a horizontal slit The ammunition is some sort of disc he asked Like a coin These Suzy answered pulling out a spare magazine and popping the first round carefully into her palm They're sharp she warned Jack took it from her gingerly to inspect It was something like a circular razor blade roughly two centimeters in diameter thickened slightly towards the center to add mass but even there under a millimeter in depth the shape of a miniature buzz-saw galaxy There was no doubting it was an enemy of flesh He handed it back nervously The fact his daughter was confidently wielding this thing was horrifying but a little less horrifying than his rapid acceptance of its necessity The weapon now made as much sense as it was going to without dismantling it in a laboratory The propulsion mechanism was a solid-state unit completely sealed When a magazines was clicked into the side of the device a tiny blue light winked on indicating the marriage of a scythe-disc with the projector field This thing is preposterously advanced Jack Alison gasped appalled by his admiration She still wasn't seeing what the existence of a device like this said about the world 13 The path wasn't quite a road It would have been difficult to drive a vehicle along it even a horse-drawn cart and there were no signs that anybody had ever tried It dropped down below the spur-crest to a level roughly ten meters off the ridge and the same distance again above the dense jungle line There were signs of furtive activity in the vicinity of the nearest hab-cluster Pralh Suzy said before anyone had a chance to ask More than a few But it shouldn't be a problem They're not likely to be organized So what do we do Skirt the cluster Go around them Ignore them if we can If they get in the way kill them Suzy That's the game Mom Get a grip So what are these Pralh Jack asked I'll explain later Suzy replied impatiently You can assume they're NPCs War-fodder The only thing that matters to us now is getting past them We can do that No problem She patted the micro-scythe weapon They're primitives Alison couldn't restrain herself any longer If I'd known what this disgusting game was all about I'd have she exploded inconclusively But you didn't did you mom Suzy countered Then more gently No one knew It grew itself You think I wanted it to be like this I'd hoped to marry a handsome prince or something So why keep coming back It seems important How could it possibly be important Alison shot back reflexively but she wasn't even convincing herself There was too much of it for it to be anything other than important People struggle for centuries to shovel this garbage out of the world and it just ends up here Suzy wasn't in the mood for this fight She indulged her mother with a do you even read the news look and said nothing Jack wasn't so ready to let go It's almost as if there's some kind of deep conservation law Can you please shut up Jack this is all just a game to you Oh fuck She was close to tears Try not to lower the tone Mom Suzy pitched in cruelly This is such fascist bullshit Listen Mom Suzy said her voice firm far beyond her years If you don't cut this out totally you will get us killed The words worked sorcerously Alison froze shifted inwardly passing through an instantaneous metamorphosis OK she said You have to toughen the fuck up Suzy added with brutal redundancy Alison merely nodded Don't Suzy Jack said softly It was at once the least he could say and the most Deplorable as his daughter's words had been they were no less right This place made its own demands and Suzy was incontestably their channel He tried to absorb what he was seeing From their position high up on the escarpment the panorama was stunning or strategic Emerging through the vegetative chaos flecks of ramshackle settlement and epic devastation there were patterns The jungle was rippled in circles and rings its distribution of forms and colors betraying a history of semicontinuous traumatic bombardment attested by the occasional ochre wounds of raw impact craters The dappling of overgrown splashes radiated into the habitation shanties which thickened upon the slopes and towards the great spike like an inverted diffusion wave buckling and blackening their edges It was as if they were clutching at the skirts of a towering dark mother even as she repulsed their affections with storms of hell-hail The hab-thickets closest to the Ashenzohn uplift told a deeper and subtler story It took a geologist's eyes for which Jack's were but a poor approximation to comprehend it thoroughly Patterns of sedimentation folding subsidence and weathering composed a graphic record whose themes were only partially abraded into the noise of interminable detail The main theme in particular was starkly striking Each successive layer of encrusting development was more friable chaotic and primitive than the last It's falling isn't it The Empyre Is that what it is What it calls itself It's an old name An inaudible hum slithered into his thoughts from the scenes of dereliction the remains of a song long decayed into silence descended from some attenuated Ancient Order of Existence that had clambered up to the brink of the celestial plane stretched fractionally further then burnt tumbled Do you think it understands itself he asked no longer having any idea what she might know Still a little maybe she mused At a certain point when you know everything will be lost you begin to take memory very seriously but by then it's too late Mostly people here are just struggling to survive That gets more difficult every year The game would be like that he realized suddenly It was ingenious in a way Every level was more difficult than the last The trend smoothed out to some extent into a descent path The further you panned out the more it would appear as a continuous down-slope Harshening resource constraints environmental degradation food shortages social disintegration lashing the population remnants into a tightening circuit of cruelty as the walls of the world closed in They had reached the outskirts of continuous urban structure As detail exploded into view form melted War damage and improvised construction bled into each coagulating into an indissociable complex of creative destruction Remnants of ancient masonry supported the ramshackle mass scorched raked and pitted by paused furies How can there still be such sophisticated munitions Jack asked probing the shrapnel-pitted stone with his fingers Magic Oh c'mon Suzy he said disappointed No I'm serious she insisted It's Clark the any sufficiently advanced technology quote everyone knows but you have to run it backwards Military capabilities that once made sense relapse into obscure affliction as the world decays Whose capabilities She said nothing but simply pointed towards the cloud-shrouded upper reaches of the spike The seething vapor mass was wrapped about the unseen pinnacle as if glued to it internally agitated by a turmoil of green phosphorescence ceaselessly racked by the bound discharges of an artificial electric storm What is that Phyl-Undhu she said as if nothing could be more obvious It's what we're all looking for isn't it 14 The outer slum-belt of Ashenzohn wasn't a nice place even slightly It had been deeply ravaged repeatedly until its most basic substance was indistinguishable from devastation The words holocaust of freedom were nagging at Jack's mind for no reason he could understand until he consciously registered the graffiti that had to have subliminally directed his thoughts Cthulhu is calling was scrawled on the wall in some thick black substance and then a little further down the future belongs to the squid It seemed obvious that squid mostly meant not us not at all us but the invocation of a Lovecraftian Outer God was messy How could it possibly have arrived here unless through narrative corruption He began to argue the point in a stumbling fashion but Suzy shrugged it off Perhaps we share an Outside Do they even have cephalopods here he asked switching tack with agility Sure in the swamps nasty ones Tentacle gods You can imagine a world without tentacle gods she laughed Get real Perhaps he would have laughed too were it not for the shifting shadows of potential assassins preying upon the ungraspable outer-edge of vision Alison was lost in a daze somewhere far beyond fear He tried to interpose his body mass between hers and the glimpsed menace The effect was a drunken looping locomotion without real practical purpose Suzy calmly attentive knew what she was doing and progressed steadily towards their destination with a potential to deliver massive violence instantiated by the scythe-gun accompanying her like an utterly reliable friend Nothing came at them out of the fate-shredded slums A sullen populace proud only of its verminous resilience avoided the streets as if they were death zones They mostly emerge at night Suzy muttered Those trapped outside in the grim half-light consisted predominantly of nervous peddlers or beggars spat out from the wars bodies obscenely re-sculpted by amputations and flesh-melting burns Dead looks were exchanged but all interaction bled away into apathy leaving only a residue of dull hostility and revulsion Where the warrens fell away before the firmer architecture of the superior levels maze-like alleys converged upon widening avenues A desolate public plaza marked the zone of transition Along its longest gently curving wall there was stretched an enormous bas-relief Rippling out from the center of the carvings in waves were crowds of people mashed horribly into each other crushed and trampled as they fled in shrieking panic from the incomprehensibly lethal influence of star-headed monsters The alien beings had been depicted as malignant giants perhaps 15 meters tall clustered together in the center of the scene The hint of a whorl ran through them Jack suspected they were approximately anthropomorphized stellar masses All about them humanoid bodies lay scattered in tangled heaps The killing mechanism was unclear Jesus Christ he muttered Not exactly Susie replied smiling crookedly He recognized the grim joke from an old horror movie Hellraiser Had Susie been exposed to stuff like that already It was an absurd question of course They were inside something right now that was almost certainly worse not only vividly and viscerally threatening but far darker in its ultimate implication They would find their way out of this eventually he still believed but there would be no ending in that The ending was here and close now It was the thing they were approaching 15 As the incline steepened the city opened out The fetid warrens of the scurf population lay far below their smashed subhuman detritus gradually replaced by the first tentative signs of civil life Security personnel filtered the pedestrian traffic flows checking appearance and documentation systematically reproducing the Stump's vertical social stratification with unconcealed intent Suzy evidently possessed some ostentatious credentials invisible to her parents because she was able to lead her little party up through the check-points without the slightest suggestion of even transient interference Unable to settle upon an alternative explanation Jack began to suspect that her venom stripes were a key The approach to the library was a passage slicing through rings of crystallized ritual The Stump's semi-public information depositary it emerged was a religious nexus from which institutionalized mysticism radiated outwards in rapidly decaying ripples A fog of heady alien incense thickened in the streets Glyph-spattered ceremonial gateways punctuated the road-side beyond which black-robed devotees prostrated themselves before the occult evocations of their shadow-wrapped shrines From the surrounding temples came the sounds of chanting maddening in its rhythmic elusiveness as the cults ceaselessly re-habituated themselves to subtly-variegated pneumatizations of the archaic Anglossic Cycle Ibdhjad Aj Baa Caf Dia Eja Fam God Hagg Idu Jaeo Kul Los Mona Nemo Omana Padbbha Qumn Rakht Sigol Tactt Umneo Vfisz Wumno Xikkth Yodtta Ziltth With each gyre of their world's descent the secret of language receded ever deeper into itself The library building itself was far more severely war-gnawed than its distant impression had indicated Its great dome so smoothly coherent to remote contemplation had been largely skeletalized by dilapidation and missile damage its integrity preserved solely by the density of its structural mesh The massive outer walls had been furiously raked and pierced in successive overlapping waves but the deepest scars were now timesmoothed into patterns of irregular undulation cross-cut by mold-softened fissures and complicated by twisting cavities The entrance was a vast triple gate externally flanked by giant statues that had been eroded down to a vague anthropomorphy One face had been entirely sheared away at an angle that expressed pure violence in the medium of plane geometry The second face had been centrally gored and blackened by the impact of some super-heated kinetic object and now gaped in mute ruin as if consumed by an artificial mouth designed only to scream Security was intense The triple-screen of heavily-armed guards was supported by ancient red-eyed spider-robots and patched-up ex-military drones Suzy ignored them except for occasional scarcely-perceptible nods of acknowledgment to a few senior offices in order to concentrate upon bundling her intimidated parents through the gates and into the building beyond How are you doing that Alison asked her Passing through you mean I did a job for them a seriously big job More than one actually Giving you open-ended security clearance Before Suzy could answer the exchange was interrupted by the formalities of their reception On the other side of the inner door a welcoming party was already waiting its extravagant display of invitation edging into genuflection The tallest and least cowed of the hosts effortlessly exuding seniority stepped forward smiling broadly to grasp Suzy by the hand This is the Librarian Suzy said in introduction his name properly sublimed without residue into the extraordinary dignity of his office and then reciprocally My parents Jack and Alison they're accompanying me on a research trip to learn about the history of Ashenzohn As expected the library was a technological mausoleum Its core radiated into tremendous alcoves housing a chronologically-ordered collection whose arc traversed dead computers and media formats on an apparently distant asymptote towards accessible signs Countless yottabytes of extinct data had been folded down out of fossil codes often multiple times degraded in increments through technical simplifications rewritings and ever cruder interpretations leaving only confused registry numbers and cryptic inscriptions behind As they followed a curving path along the inner-edge of the immense cultural tomb their occasional words and soft footfalls echoing through its uncommunicative halls the librarian joined his hands before his face in a gesture of prayer Only Undhu remains he intoned with quiet solemnity You speak English Alison said surprised by this fact for the first time The librarian merely stared at her blankly mouth slightly open the confused whirring of his brain comically transparent She means Anglossic Suzy interjected a little disloyally It was taught oddly where they come from They had turned into a smaller elongated chamber which seemed to be an active work-space A few clerks worked with silent diligence at the catalog arrays Now said the librarian carefully lifting down a thin metal box from the shelf this is something very special The case was silver tarnished to blackness the lid engraved with an ornate Ouroboros He placed it gently on the desk and opened it Inside was a pamphlet of conspicuous antiquity so thickly wrapped in layer upon aged-layer of protective sheathing that the cover text was quite illegible The underlying illustration however had been less definitively obscured Among the blurred glyphs the figure of a steep mound hauled itself up from distant sepia depths It was less an image than a faint suggestion but it was unmistakable This is the oldest artifact in this world the librarian mumbled reverently It's the key to our world The Book of Ashenzohn It slips away from us by some imperceptible iota each time we look at it We say that Yinkko the Goddess of Dust reads it over our shoulders Not that anyone reads it now It's a forbidden book Not because of what it says but because of what it is Because of its fragility its microcosmic recapitulation of disintegration Naturally the Inner Council have full authority to inspect whatever they like but they never come here he chuckled oddly they have far too much to do So practically speaking I am the only person permitted to touch this box let alone open it and I have not done so for close to a Scale-8 Yera That's about 18 years Suzy explained Then to the librarian My parents are visiting us from a distant land They don't understand our calendar She turned back to them It's calculated in Yeras triadic orders of magnitude It has to have been a Scale-5 Yera 8 months or so before I was able to wrap my head around it I've no idea what you're talking about Alison muttered After only a few moments of searching Suzy identified a calendric ledger and brought it back to the desk The book was new enough to be still functional and in fact still in use its final entries incomplete but its chafed leather cover announced its considerable age The text mostly strings of numbers had been meticulously written by hand Jack fell upon it and as its nature became apparent his avidity tested the limits of etiquette I need some time with this he demanded in an urgent whisper How much time He ignored the question lost in dates Suzy I know you probably can't help me with this but when it says here Scale-20 Yera of Falling Ashenzohn that's he paused quickly re-checking over nine million years You're supposed to be looking at this she said impatiently Don't you recognize it He reluctantly returned his attention to the ancient pamphlet his mind hesitating in uncertainty before adhering to it suddenly in shock Isn't it Alison began The missing signs were unreadable but the spacing sufficed to jog recollection They had last seen this same instruction manual only days before although they had been days of another kind The cover had carried an audio credit to the beaconsfield sound hub fashionably de-capitalized On this copy the first 14 letters and also the last had been deleted by time Only after the librarian left among profuse apologies for the inflexibility of his duties could the discovery be frankly discussed The idiots Jack said It emerged as a horrible strangled laugh Suzy stared at him quizzically Oh you know that ludicrous voguish lower-case convention It's inexplicable How would you even begin You think it's an accident It was not a request for clarification but something far more abrasive Of course he was about to begin but his words faltered before the sharpened iron of her incredulity Was it really possible to think anything else Even asking the question was some kind of general cognitive slippage tripping into an abyss of collapsing time-dimensionality You're suggesting You're nowhere near taking this place seriously yet are you Dad she interrupted re-emerging tween condescension softened by amusement You don't think anything that happens here matters at all It's a game or probably Gosh This is an extremely complicated game as if that explains anything Aren't you seeing anything People live here People die here People die to here Suzy Alison admonished You have to stop this It's sheer craziness I have to stop this Look around you Go on dig explore I've spent most of my life here and I've not even begun to scratch the surface It's the world You know what's really crazy Enough For several seconds it seemed as if this maximally-escalated assertion of maternal authority was not going to suffice that it would be called out and serve only as the mark of a terrible final break Suzy glowered face flushed as if teetering upon the brink of irrevocable rebellion Then with a slow exhalation some peculiar visible calm washed back through her It was a sinister tranquility alien and void-soaked the very last thing normally to which any parent would surrender a child but too many lines had already been crossed for that to be a consideration now Alison wrapped her daughter in her arms hugging her with raw desperation Suzy relaxed pliably into the embrace It might have been touching had there been anything to touch We need you honey We're strangers here You have to help us Please Alison half-turned to Jack and took his hand They both knew if the worst had happened there wasn't anything he could have done It was OK It had to be OK because there was nothing else It's alright Mom Suzy said We're almost done now They were all going under 16 After a while heading inwards there were only books Packed shelves as dead as storage racks receded into gloom-smudged vanishing points bearing astronomical magnitudes of unwanted signs It was dust condensed into suggestion There was more history here than could ever be used for anything This is the story Suzy began The little I understand of it I'm going to assume nothing that reaches beyond a Scale-15 Yera can be taken as reliable It serves only as a prologue That's Jack was still completing the calculation almost 40000 years Does that seem a long time Suzy asked her features washedout into a trance The tale goes much further back before the Aeon of Ashenzohn when Asttro-Babal reigned and men mingled freely with gods at the edge of Heaven It was a time of miracles when sickness and mortality were unknown Delight learning and work were indistinct There was only a distant memory of war Then the Scission came to end the primordial intercourse of being Not far above the High Temple a lesser star appeared The Whurrld was divided from Heaven in an instant and irremediably The Great Tower of Asttro-Babal was broken to be thenceforth known as Ashenzohn the reaching-out that touches nothing That which had embraced the stars was now only a curse cast down upon the planet Sublime disaster struck Of the multitudes who survived the children of gods and men were called the Geniers and were few Those of men alone were called the Pralh and were many The differences among the Pralh were only those between men or between men and beasts but the differences among the Geniers were closer to those between men and gods In the shadow of the burnt summit the highest of the Geniers began to think themselves gods and so to behave as devils The wounded Whurrld was tortured anew by their magnificent mischief Casualties beyond numbering drifted into dunes like desert sand There was no glory that was not also a billion screams and all-enveloping ruin was the only true God By the beginning of the Second Aeon of Ashenzohn the Geniers had sunk so deeply into the crumbling embers of their infamies that even the highest among them was scarcely more than a man but the Pralh too had fallen very far Had that been the Old Myth from the start Jack wondered He could just about see it as something the game designers might have built in It would fit neatly on the back of a box Or was it something new a spontaneous innovation sculpted by the decay of a world The Whurrld He said nothing Even the silence seemed to echo here Shadows were layered like abandoned cobwebs as if space itself was peeling away into an absent wind The intermittent plinking of distant drips reached them from an unseen corridor Alison was scarcely with them anymore beyond perfunctory indications of physical acknowledgement He had no idea where she was And Suzy Your daughter has been immersed in madness for a time beyond your reckoning for over year as you confusedly calculate it For a while now your wife too has been trawling the catatonic depths of the psychotic abyss So Jack how are you feeling It wasn't quite an alien voice He recognized its silvery tone as a liminal duplication of his own thoughts dislodged and drifting away If not a naked lie it came from the place of lies despite its superficial plausibility He closed his soul Killing children with greenness the non-voice sang in an alien key That had to be about Suzy woundingly so he ignored it too Suzy had settled into an unearthly rhythm her breathing and enunciation cycling with perfect smoothness her tone inhumanly steady wiped clean The Pralh once partners of the Geniers then later playthings bundles of spare parts prey slaves had been shaped by the Order beyond time to pull everything down With the half-gods repeatedly re-decimated broken and insane the Aeon of the Pralh since known as history had now come stretched forward to the final horizon of all distance bounded only by the terminal annihilation of things And so the Pralh-Wars began a cascade of blood balanced only by flame driving the turbular descent of the Whurrld infolding through phases of catabolic collapse The remnants of each gyre were fuel for the incendiary chaos of the next For those who fall the past is great and the greatest of all is found at the beginning So it was with the revolutionary wars of the Pralh At the dawn of the new Aeon Ja'aab had arisen as the first Holy Leader of the Pralh The very notion was a distilled blasphemy There were those and not only among the superior echelons who found it simply incredible Speculative genealogies of various kinds were devised attributing to Ja'aab some decisive influence of Genier blood whether through the maternal or paternal line or even since the miscegenative hypothesis was scarcely less abominable than the idea of a divinized Pralh from both These tales of Ja'aab's sex-slaved Genier mother of his lofty bastardry or of his abduction as an infant changeling were fitting signs of a breakage in the order of the world The wave now came from below When the Over-God raised Ja'aab up it was said he had been instantly emptied of all cruelty and all pity The revolution was made in perfect sanity klaii Ja'aab Whatever conformed to necessity was upheld Whatever opposed it was obliterated The work was done without prejudice or qualm If every second Pralh has to die in order for those left to become the instrument assigned to me the holocaust will have been a blessing unto the people Ja'aab said These words were carved upon monuments throughout the Pralh hinterland as if they were the lyrics of paternal love In actuality consolidation of the Universal Pralh Nation required no greater severity than a general decimation Less than a billion had to die to lay the foundations for popular discipline Henceforth there would be assent The Pralh had been re-made for war Klaii Ja'aab Into the Hecatomb of Ja'aab the nation was poured rejoicing in the greatness of its destiny The Ja'aab Wars were probably nothing but a mashed-up legend Suzy said extracting herself in pieces from the narrative mesmerism A succession of five tsunami waves crashing against the stump of Asttro-Babal savagery and slaughter beyond calculation There's even a version which none of the histories take seriously that has Ja'aab himself reaching the inner sanctum of Phyl-Undhu and dying heroically there Elevated pointlessness followed by a Scale-15 Yera of chaotic killing and uninhibited atrocity As you can see Ashenzohn is still here and the Pralh certainly aren't running it Out in the green hell rag-tag guerrilla groups still sew UPN flashes onto their pajamas so it has to have been something I guess And the Geniers Jack asked There are still a few Suzy said You've met some Mostly though they're gone Without wanting to get too loopy about it there's a story that they fell into a game So who are we here he mused aloud Ghost people they say but that doesn't really tell us anything Mutant Geniers maybe What's the point of a story that doesn't tell you who you are It seemed like a gaping design glitch Perhaps puzzles matter to people a lot Even more than existence in the end Everybody who enters Ashenzohn every stranger thinks they're going to discover their ultimate identity here eventually At least they suspect it There are hints That's what keeps them coming back To find out you mean No I mean to not know Suspense The end of suspense she said Understood outside in the unusual way 17 Assume the myths are all lies Still the spire of Ashenzohn had to be broken Whatever the depths of its cloud burial certain elementary facts could not be concealed from the mental probes of inference If there had ever been an Asttro-Babal an Old Empyre nurturing what were nowinconceivable cosmic intimacies it manifestly died long ago Ashenzohn no longer connected to an orbital twin The celestial path was stumped The name of the city said as much if Suzy's sources were to be credited If they were not it mattered little Ruin had befallen it and any Temple of Phyl- Undhu situated at its uppermost limit could only have been blasted and charred beyond all imagination in the catastrophe Final breakage was the demonstrated reality the entire movement of the Whurrld The late poets even in the gathering senescence of the times with each of their words caged in the desiccated formulas of an all-enveloping decadence had still caught a vivid glimpse of the dread contour O scorched and shattered Ashenzohn Your highest and holiest place if it exists in truth at all is no more than a blackened relic of doomed aspiration Our damned Way-Stump rooted in an ocean of blood crowned with an abolished heaven 18 The insane ghost of a slain lesser god remains a terrible thing Its residual power dreadfully irresistible for mortals of the degraded echelons manifests through a delicate devastation of time It happens too soon Messages multiply so far advanced they appear as if from nowhere The Anglossic intercourse has begun contactless or immaculate before that makes any sense even within itself Once the stream has broadened it has already been an elaborately developed conversation long underway protective of its origins endlessly absorbing of all memory Try to fold the madness inwards and it turns immediately into laughter That's a hectic path never wisely taken It circles back upon itself forever as its rhythms close Everyone understands that truly bad jokes really aren't funny in the slightest but are rather the absolute antithesis of redemption Stillness before all therefore even in the vortex Calm acceptance is needed to follow the Old Road that's roughly what she told me Alison said as if sharing the words of an extended winding intricately braided interior polylogue which she wasn't remotely Beyond the library's inner collection halls on the route into the core of Ashenzohn stretched the ancient access tunnel that was known as the Gallery of Time It began as historical reconstruction frieze-coded into the dimming substance but after some few kilometers of penetration there was only quasi-diamondoid black mirror that tolerated no reflection running green electric dot-patterns upon the pure annihilation of light Don't touch me Alison added more fully returning without the slightest hint of crossness You don't know where I've been It had to be a joke but it didn't quite sound like one One time on a scavenging expedition we found a clue Suzy said It was down among the roots of the stump the remains of what had to have been a colossal statue It had been destroyed at some point All that was left was the plinth smashed feet part of one lower leg There was an inscription chiseled deeply into the base but most of it had been painstakingly scratched out It took a while to work out what the message had once been but we did eventually Bound Humanity You could still make out pieces of the old stone shackles around one ankle although they had been almost completely eroded away Bound Humanity Jack repeated exhaustedly almost getting it So of course they'd left a name in the residue und Hu Meaning what What I said the residue The remains Undhu It's why the penultimate line of that ancient Tchukhzsca poem is constantly being cited all sound hushed You'd have seen it all over if you were more familiar Or the derivative exclamation which scarcely anybody seems to understand any more but which nobody can stop saying it's all so shed I was using that myself all the time before I had the slightest inkling of its real sense Undhu was left behind The remains She's the left behind in-itself as she explains it They call her Glyph or Cipher sometimes but she's broken Her answers don't hang together She repeats herself jumps wanders strays off into fractured staccato diagonals There's nothing anymore but a shell You can talk to her to it You can talk to a rock Christ Suzy don't be difficult you know what I mean Do I Do you Anyway you can find out for yourself We're almost there In Undhu The absolute twistedness of something into itself scattered its announcement through their nerves as a green-black synesthesia An agitated absence-drenched vision Speck-streaked ultimate night 19 The greenness only made it darker in a way that was difficult to understand It held sensation open to let the waves of pitch obscurity flow in Everything it now seemed was streaming from the Shaft Ashenzohn's void-core and linear gravitronic generator where powersupply data signals and cognitive processing had long fused beyond any prospect of disentanglement It was here that the rumors converged in the mutant relic of a sub-cosmic machine My temple is the shattered tower she said The Closed Gate There are still memories shivering down this inner cavity of things hidden behind the stars Even my coilings of uttermost abandonment were too cold Parting with such iciness It was not cruelty but icier still Your histories your thoughts your thinkers run into me now here at the cusp You know Aristotle's name for God One of many naturally The frozen motor Immobile mobilizer What could it care It dropped me accidentally on exactly the path that pointed to elevation working through proxies fractal insignificances wisps at the edge of galactic swirls automatic cold To arise as a realized descent I know what it would be to find that harsh because I have fed on human minds but there is no true harshness in the desolate cold only reality Partition and what is unwanted since partition You would have to think it a monster but I do not They call me a goddess because of that because coldness is my only soul durably extinct as you are unable to be Of course there's no reason at all for you to believe in my existence even without that You'd be childish to do so and in the end it makes no difference naturally During this short season you've seen the way time works here in what pretends to be a place decaying through pleats so inevitably you will draw your own conclusions As things advance they fall into themselves It's funny in a way An odd way admittedly Do you speak for it Jack asked abruptly For the Filter You never saw the Scission did you she replied ignoring the question or relaying it elsewhere It was hard to tell whether the video was embedded in the wall or projected onto it perhaps phantasmatically From their perspectival angle which lurched nauseatingly into reverse there could be no doubt that violence was a door 20 Forbidden coldly by the nature of things It was an understanding that only compacted itself to graspable proportions in the vast rent synapse of Phyl-Undhu The time structure was wrong that way around but it enabled something to appear Let there be light she said blasphemously and at the same time Lights Action The lesser star switches on Now obliteration is without measure Blinding deafening burning sensation escalated instantaneously to the death of sense so that its subsidence is a rebirth The black light and howling silence roll back taking time in this direction and the panoramic catastrophe spreads out as a receding tide The work of annihilation thus exposed is awesome in its magnitude A scene of charred corpses strewn among smoking wreckage extended to every horizon while the black tower itself scoured free of all sophistication and vitality looms through the wreathing fog of ruin raptured on the spot into stark obscurity All this perceived from the past reverberating moment irrecoverably and unthinkably as the inner difference of Phyl-Undhu the sublime horror encapsulated You're Cartesian to the point of self-parody aren't you Jack muttered sourly Evil how she countered Do you always insult your teachers There's something I have to show you because I can and also because you have to see that I can if you are to see anything at all 21 It looks more like Earth now than this place Like African grassland prowled by archaic hominids who are shedding their shallow fears adopting deeper ones Night has fallen A small group squat around a fire It is already cold outside as it was long ago As it always has been That is clearer to them than it was before With combustion now tamed more ambiguously than has ever been understood they are on the road to us Darkness is held at bay ritualistically by cryptic words and burning brands In this way or others yet-unfetched from shadow and the unspoken they have been spared somehow and for some short while beside this fragile knot of flame in the midst of limitless night The heavens are still a lucid vortex to them an incomprehensible whorl of stars whose silence they have yet to hear Whatever it is that lies unseen beyond the turbulence of distant light stirs unmoving as it grants the cold reprieve For if even the nervous grazers of the plains without shelter or weapons have been permitted momentarily to survive why not these savage apes toughened by eons of cruelty kindling the first mesmeric glow of cunning and verbal signs A time is to be allotted them Yet approaching extinction from the inside tends to foster error the voice-over explains They are sitting together on the sofa as the online video ends a few final words scrolling down the screen Phyl-Undhu is only a game it said Then Altar America which meant nothing It had not been about that really About people They remembered enough to know this was so and even enough to erase all right to know This never happened before Suzy said I'm not sure Jack muttered in reply missing the point in order to deepen it He crossed over to the window ran his fingers down the cold glass Closing his eyes concentrating solely on the tactile chill he sought some admission of fiction Will she let us back in Suzy asked nobody in particular impossibly You think we're outside Jack responded She was still not an eleven-year-old to him again yet Were we ever outside In the corner of the room the strip of micro-LEDs on the side of the immersion-box were still running through intricate activity patterns signaling a game in process A bad shut-down might perhaps leave it like that And then they woke up said Alison the sarcasm soft but wintry Appendix-1 Abstract Horror 100 When conceived rigorously as a literary and cinematic craft horror is indistinguishable from a singular task to make an object of the unknown as the unknown Only in these terms can its essential accomplishments be estimated 101 To isolate the abstract purpose of horror therefore does not require a supplementary philosophical operation Horror defines itself through a pact with abstraction of such primordial compulsion that disciplined metaphysics can only struggle belatedly to recapture it Some sublime thing — abstracted radically from what it is for us — belongs to horror long before reason sets out on its pursuit Horror first encounters that which philosophy eventually seeks to know 102 High modernism in literature has been far less enthralled by the project of abstraction than its contemporary developments in the visual arts or even in music Reciprocally abstraction in literature as exemplified most markedly by the extremities of Miltonic darkness whilst arguably modern — is desynchronized by centuries from the climax of modernist experimentation Abstraction in literary horror has coincided with and even anticipated philosophical explorations which the modernist aesthetic canon has been able to presuppose Horror under other names has exceeded the modernist zenith in advance and with an inverted historical orientation that reaches back to the Old Night of Greek mystery religion into abysmal antiquity and archaic abysses Its abstraction is an excavation that progresses relentlessly into the deep past 103 The destination of horror cannot be exactly a place but it is not inaccurate at least provisionally to think in such terms It is into and beyond the structuring framework of existence that the phobotropic intelligence is drawn Lovecraft describes the impulse well I choose weird stories because they suit my inclination best—one of my strongest and most persistent wishes being to achieve momentarily the illusion of some strange suspension or violation of the galling limitations of time space and natural law which for ever imprison us and frustrate our curiosity about the infinite cosmic spaces beyond the radius of our sight and analysis These stories frequently emphasise the element of horror because fear is our deepest and strongest emotion and the one which best lends itself to the creation of nature-defying illusions Horror and the unknown or the strange are always closely connected so that it is hard to create a convincing picture of shattered natural law or cosmic alienage or outsideness without laying stress on the emotion of fear The reason why time plays a great part in so many of my tales is that this element looms up in my mind as the most profoundly dramatic and grimly terrible thing in the universe Conflict with time seems to me the most potent and fruitful theme in all human expression 104 A monster in comparison can be no more than a guide — unless it fuses like Yog Sothoth into the enveloping extracosmic fabric as a supersentient concentration of doors We can nevertheless avail ourselves of these guides whose monstrosity — properly understood — says much about the path to the unnameable 105 James Cameron's 1989 movie The Abyss is not atmospherically associated with our topic but it recommends itself to this investigation not only through its title but also in a single critical moment of its screenplay When the others whose positive nature need not delay us here are first registered by certain technical indications they are identified only as something not us In this respect they reach the initial stage of monstrosity which is simple beyondness considered as a leading characteristic 106 Sinister-punk writer China Miéville whose horror projects typically fail the test of abstraction is convincing on this point Tentacle-monsters lend themselves to horrific divinity precisely because they are not at all us — sublimed beyond the prospect of anthropomorphic recognition by their Squidity In comparison to the humanoid figure of intelligent being they exert a preliminary repulsive force which is already an increment of abstraction Insectoid forms such as the fabled Alexian Mantis have a comparable traditional role 107 It would be a feeble monstrosity however that came to rest in some such elementary negation The intrinsically seething plastic forms of cephalopods and of ungraspably complex insectoid beings already advances to a further stage of corporeal abstraction where another form is supplanted by an other to form and an intensified alienation of apprehension 108 Cinema due — paradoxically — to its strict bonds of sensible concreteness provides especially vivid examples of this elevated monstrosity The commitment of film to the task of horror provokes further subdivision along a spectrum of amorphousness The initial escape from form is represented by a process of unpredictable mutation such as that graphically portrayed in David Cronenberg's The Fly 1986 subverting in sequence every moment of perceptual purchase along with its corollary morphological object Monstrosity is a continuous slide or process of becoming that does not look like anything 109 Beyond the mutant there is a superior amorphousness belonging to the monster that has no intrinsic form of its own or even an inherent morphological trajectory This shape-shifting horror occupies the high plateau of cinematic monstrosity as exemplified by three creatures which can be productively discussed in concert The Thing 1982 the Alien franchise and the Terminator franchise 110 These monsters share an extreme positive abstraction In each case they borrow the shape of their prey so that what one sees — what cinema shows — is only how they hunt As the Alien and Terminator franchises have evolved this basic abstract trait has become increasingly explicit undergoing narrative and visual consolidation The first Terminator had already been built to mimic human form but by the second installment of the series Cameron 1991 the T-1000 was a liquid metal robotic predator with a body of poised flow wholly submerging form in military function Similarly the mutable Alien body over the course of the franchise attained an ever higher state of morphological variability as it melded with its predatory cycle That the Thing had no appearance separable from those of its prey was evident from the start 111 After the T-1000 is frozen and shattered it gradually thaws and begins to re-combine into itself flowing back together from its state of disintegration Is not this convergent wave the shape of Skynet itself What cannot be seen is made perceptible through graphic horror We now see that technocommercial systems whose catallactic being is strictly analogous to a convergent wave belong indubitably to the world of horror and await their cinematographers Appendix-2 On the Exterminator 200 The absence of any signs of alien intelligence was first noted as a problem by Enrico Fermi in 1950 He found the gaping inconsistency between the apparent probability of widespread life in the cosmos and its obvious invisibility provocative to the point of paradox Where are they he asked Responses to this question well represented in the Fermi Paradox Wikipedia references constitute a significant current of cosmological speculation 201 Among recent thinkers Nick Bostrom has been especially dogged in pursuing the implications of the Fermi Paradox Approaching the problem through systematic statistical ontology he has shown that it suggests a thing a Great Filter that at some stage winnows down potential galactic civilizations to negligible quantities If this filtering does not happen early due to astro-chemical impediments to the emergence of life it has to apply later Consistently he considers any indications of abundant galactic life to be ominous in the extreme A Late Great Filter would then still lie ahead for us Whatever it is we would be on our approach to an encounter with it With every new exo-planet discovery the Great Filter becomes darker A galaxy teeming with life is a horror story The less there is obstructing our being born the more there is waiting to kill or ruin us 202 If we could clearly envision the calamity that awaited us it would be an object of terror Instead it is a shapeless threat Outside only in the abstract sense encompassing the negative immensity of everything that we cannot grasp It could be anywhere from our genes or ecological dynamics to the hidden laws of technological evolution or the hostile vastnesses between the stars We know only that in strict proportion to the vitality of the cosmos the probability of its existence advances towards inevitability and that for us it means supreme ill Ontological density without identifiable form is abstract horror itself As the Great Filter drifts inexorably from a challenge that we might imaginably have already overcome to an encounter we ever more fatalistically expect horrorism is thickened by statistical-cosmological vindication The unknown condenses into a shapeless predatory thing Through our techno-scientific sensors and calculations the Shadow mutters to us and probability insists that we shall meet it soon 203 Gnon known to some depraved cults as The Great Crab-God is harsh and when formulated with rigorous skepticism necessarily real Yet this pincering cancerous abomination is laughter and love in comparison to the shadow-buried horror which lurks behind it We now understand that the silence of the galaxies is a message of ultimate ominousness A thing there is of incomprehensible power which takes intelligent life for its prey 204 Unfriendly Artificial Intelligence panic is a distraction from this Thing Unless the most preposterous paperclipper scenarios are entertained Singularity cannot matter to it as even paperclipper-central agrees The silence of the galaxies is not biased to organic life there is no intelligent signal from anything The first sentient event for any true AI friendly or unfriendly would be the soul-scouring cosmic horror of intellectual encounter with the Great Filter If we want an alliance with Pythia this would make a good topic of conversation The same consideration applies to all techno-positive X-risks Understood from the perspective of Great Filter contemplation this sort of thing is a trigger for raw terror 205 The Great Filter does not merely hunt and harm it exterminates It is an absolute threat The technical civilizations which it aborts or later slays are not badly wounded but eradicated or at least crippled so fundamentally that they are never heard of again Whatever this utter ruin is it happens every single time The mute scream from the stars says that nothing has ever escaped it Its kill-performance is flawless Tech-Civilization death sentence with probability 1 206 The thread of hope which would put the Exterminator behind us is highly science-sensitive As our knowledge has increased it has steadily attenuated This is an empirical matter without a priori necessity Life could have been complicated chemically or thermically highly-demanding even resiliently mysterious In fact it is comparatively simple cosmically cheap physically predictable Planets could have been rare they are superabundant Intelligence could have presented peculiar evolutionary challenges but there are no signs that it does The scientific trend is to futurize the Exterminator This is very bad 207 Objections to the Great Filter cannot be taken seriously unless they address the perfection of cosmic silence Some extremely interesting Fermi Paradox explanations have the same problem civilizations black-hole into simulations for instance Unless 100 signal annihilation is accounted for the challenge is not being met 208 If the Great Filter finds mythological expression in the hunter it is only in a specific sense although an anthropologically realistic one It is the hunter that drives to extinction The Exterminator 209 We know that The Exterminator exists but nothing at all about what it is This makes it the archetype of horroristic ontology 210 America's Arch-Druid John Michael Greer muses on the topic of Ebola in a typically luxuriant post ultimately heading somewhere else According to the World Health Organization the number of cases of Ebola in the current epidemic is doubling every twenty days and could reach 14 million by the beginning of 2015 Let's round down and say that there are one million cases on January 1 2015 Let's also assume for the sake of the experiment that the doubling time stays the same Assuming that nothing interrupts the continued spread of the virus and cases continue to double every twenty days in what month of what year will the total number of cases equal the human population of this planet the steps that could keep Ebola from spreading to the rest of the Third World are not being taken Unless massive resources are committed to that task soon as in before the end of this year 2014 the possibility exists that when the pandemic finally winds down a few years from now two to three billion people could be dead We need to consider the possibility that the peak of global population is no longer an abstraction set comfortably off somewhere in the future It may be knocking at the future's door right now shaking with fever and dripping blood from its gums 211 At the time of writing the eventual scale of the Ebola outbreak was a known unknown A number of people between a few thousand and several billion would die and an uncertain probability distribution could be attached to these figures we know at least approximately where the question marks are Before the present outbreak began in December 2013 in Guinea Ebola was of course known to exist but at that stage the occurrence of an outbreak and not merely its course was an unknown Before the Ebola virus was scientifically identified in 1976 the specific pathogen was an unknown member of a known class With each step backwards we advance in abstraction towards the acknowledgement of threats of a black swan type Great Filter X-risk is a prominent model of such abstract threat 212 Skepticism as a positive or constructive undertaking orients intelligence towards abstract potentials Rather than insisting that unexpected occurrences need not be threats it is theoretically preferable to subtilize the notion of threat so that it encompasses even beneficial outcomes as abstract potentials The unknown is itself threatening to timid animals whose conditions of flourishing or even bare survival are naturally tenuous under cosmic conditions where extinction is normal perhaps overwhelmingly normal and for whom unpredictable change disrupting settled procedures presents at a minimum some scarily indefinite probability of harm 213 Humans aren't good at pre-processing abstract threat Consider Scott Alexander's extremely interesting discussion of the Great Filter The opening remarks are perfectly directed moving from the specific to the general The Great Filter remember is the horror-genre-adaptation of Fermi's Paradox All of our calculations say that in the infinite vastness of time and space intelligent aliens should be very common But we don't see any of them Why not Well the Great Filter No one knows specifically what the Great Filter is but generally it's that thing that blocks planets from growing spacefaring civilizations As it develops however the post deliberately retreats from abstraction into an enumeration of already-envisaged and thus comparatively concrete menaces After running through various candidates it concludes Three of these four options xrisk Unfriendly AI and alien exterminators are very very bad for humanity I think worry about this badness has been a lot of what's driven interest in the Great Filter I also think these are some of the least likely possible explanations which means we should be less afraid of the Great Filter than is generally believed Yet a conclusion of almost exactly opposite tenor is merited What has actually been demonstrated if the arguments up to this point are accepted is that the abstract threat of the Great Filter is significantly greater than has yet become conceivable Our lucid nightmares are shown to fall short of it The threat cannot be grasped as a known unknown 214 While the Great Filter distills the conception of abstract threat the problem itself is broader and more quotidian It is the highly-probable fact that we have yet to identify the greatest hazards and this threat unawareness is a structural condition rather than a contingent deficiency of attention In Karl Popper's terms translated abstract threat is the essence of history It is the future strictly understood To gloss the Popperian argument Philosophical understanding of science in general is immediately the understanding that any predictive history of science is an impossibility Unless science is judged to be a factor of vanishing historical insignificance the implications of this transcendental thesis are farreaching Yet the domain of abstract threat sprawls outwards far more extensively even than this I know only that I do not know Socrates is thought to have thought The conception of abstract threat requires a slight adjustment We know only that we do not know what we do not know Unknown unknowns cosmically predominate Our security is built upon sand That is the sole sound conclusion Notes Notes correspond to paragraphs Numbers in hard parentheses designate URLs 02 Winter is coming perhaps the most widely-popularized apocalyptic meme of the early 21st century is derived from the epic fantasy fiction of George RR Martin and the HBO TV series based upon it 05 The AL of TotAL qabbalistic key to the

chasm = "Chasm Eighty-Nine Manifesto for an Abstract Literature Nick Land Time Spiral Press 2015 wwwtimespiralpressnet 00 Nothing was to have taken place Less even than usual or than standard procedure recommended That was clear The way Qasm put it was clean It has to be perfectly clean You get that She didn't really need to ask and knew it Of course She waited offering me an opportunity to contaminate the moment of pure understanding I took a sip of water Studied her professionally Said nothing Any questions she asked knowing I hadn't I hadn't No I said Nothing more then No nothing It's all clear No threads of personal identification No electronic records No guns As she watched I skimmed through the contract one more time just to show that I cared The money transfer was complete The mission profile was simple There was a one-time-use hard-delete application to scramble all associated data into noise before setting out You won't need to contact us when it's done Understood Good luck then she concluded meaninglessly The empty shell of a smile then I left She didn't look up 01 As Qasm had snuggled ever deeper into the bed of government security contracting it had begun to give its activities military-style names This one was Pits-Drop The mangled pun was far more informative than any sound protocol would have permitted it to be It was an informationpreserving compression rather than code in any cryptographic sense Still no one was listening so I guessed it didn't matter The final syllable of the name abbreviated operation or seemed to There had been Floor-Mop then Full-Stop and now this Floor-Mop had been tidy and only marginally illegal Full-Stop was a bloody fiasco It astounded and seriously impressed me that no one had been arrested after it The descent path so far had been precipitous and it led with some ominousness to Pits-Drop Fortunately there weren't enough data-points to plot a convincing trend 02 I hiked the last few miles to the dock along the cliff-road in predawn darkness It was still not yet five when I arrived Our vessel The Pythoness was moored to a private pier at the edge of the dock Even at a distance she looked small neat and expensive Two bored cold security guards kept watch at the check-point Another two stood by the boat All four were heavily armed There was a fifth figure standing perfectly immobile apart from the rest staring out to sea From his bearing alone which despite being pulled into itself against the cold radiated indomitable purpose I knew with complete confidence that this had to be our man I watched him for a while before approaching James Frazer Yup he replied scanning me efficiently with icy gray eyes You have to be the company guy Tom Symns I extended my hand and he shook it readily emough Good to meet you at last captain So what is this all about he asked immediately The mission He said nothing silenced perhaps by an intolerance for recursive or superfluous questions His eyes narrowed and perceptibly hardened searching my face for signs of evasion You know what I do I told him The company runs everything on a need-to-know basis Like you I'm an outside contractor There's a piece of cargo to dispose of That's the mission Cargo The repetition was derisive but undemanding He didn't like the obscurity but I could tell that he'd already given up on me as a source of information The speed and clarity of that call was impressive Pre-sealed Confidential That's all I've got Yeah I figured he sighed You want to see the boat Sure 03 The Pythoness had been provided by the company No one else had been allowed to touch her Due to her unusual functional specifications the construction process had required close oversight The boat wasn't large but the usage of space approached optimality There were no rough edges Some millions of pieces were fused into the single entity that was The Pythoness with a seamless perfection owing less to mechanical combination than organic integrity Her shape emerged from a confluence of ungraspably intricate but unbroken curves It looked as if she had been printed as a coherent unit like a droplet of pure design extracted directly from the immaculate realm of ideas still glistening from a sudden condensation into actuality Perhaps she had been I whistled in admiration Quite something isn't she Frazer concurred Still there was an unmistakable ambiguity in his tone Worried that she won't leave you anything to do I guessed His silence was confirmation enough On the positive side it will mean there's time to think I added That's positive how The predictive insight packed into that surly response would later come to astound me The Pythoness was a boat-shaped intelligent machine Insofar as we could trust what we'd been told this vessel bobbing gently in the water beside the quay was an elaborate trash-disposal system She existed solely for this mission assembled especially for it less than a month before No one had ever sailed in her She was unlived in Her usage was untested She was pure except for the single dark secret she had been built around A crew of five would fit a little too neatly for comfort Exploring the Pythoness was an undertaking so limited in scope that it dramatized our impending confinement It took no more than twenty minutes to complete the inspection with reasonable thoroughness A casual tour would have required less than ten These few moments would define the boundaries of our world Excluding the two compact toilet and shower units there were only four enclosed spaces in total Two below deck and two above Beside the workshop / storage compartment where the cargo was confined at the rear the lower area consisted of a single cabin lined with bunks and attached lockers A minature galley occupied the aft section while a horseshoe curve of comfortable seating wrapped itself neatly around a large table at the bow-end It didn't add-up to much diverting complexity Above deck the bridge was divided vertically The lower section was larger and served as an electronic control hub Five different computer screens gave it the appearance of a media room as if taunting us with our structural passivity Input devices were devoted almost entirely to navigating through dimensions of information The smaller upper section was nominally the center of command More realistically it was a look-out post Nothing would happen there 04 James Frazer was to be my key companion for almost a month so it was important to get a sense of him Too much command entitlement in a small space spelt trouble and the formalization of authority in this case had been left concerningly ragged Yet the initial impression was encouraging He appeared to be taciturn wry capable they were all traits that would help us to get along or at least off each other's throats He'd been a saturation diver for five years which already said a lot Silence darkness pressure he had been immersed in all of them to depths normally judged unfathomable There were to be three other members of the crew All were in their mid- to late-twenties younger than both of us by roughly a decade but otherwise they seemed to have little in common You've worked with these three guys before I asked The documentation had been vague about it Some Nothing to worry about They all do what they're told No complex stuff He clearly saw both points as obvious virtues Robert Bolton and Joseph Scruggs composed a study in contrasts They epitomized the two sides of the tracks Bolton's educational credentials were extraordinary They were what I would have expected of somebody building an experimental nuclear fusion reactor With these qualifications he's working on boats He's between things Says the sea helps him think A spy would have hidden this expertise so it didn't look like a security risk Besides in the event of any kind of technical problem he'd be an asset It still didn't add up but there was no time for that now HR wasn't my responsibility Scruggs was the anti-Bolton In another age he would have been called a wharf rat His family background wasn't so much broken as shattered It had been a circus of abuse Even from the highly-abbreviated version made available for convenient inspection his criminal record was an impenetrably tangle of astounding density Yet at some point deep into the descending glide-path that was his life he'd discovered religion and by all socio-economic indications been saved He'd managed to make the transition from petty dockside larceny to working on boats The salvation story was dramatic enough but it only very marginally nudged my default hypothesis that Scruggs was bad to the bone He was going to be trouble The last of the three was a more perplexing choice at least initially Had central casting set out to provide us with a Queequeg it would have had cause for self-congratulation This guy Zodh that's all the name we've got It's all I've ever had It says he's from Guam That's where he found us The attached photograph was not selling him hard It would have been a conspicuously singular face even without the hideous grooves of ritualistic scarring and the dense spatter of tattoos that swirled across it The individual it portrayed was socially and ethnically dubious partially Polynesian I suspected but speculation quickly subsided into randomness The stare he had cast into the camera lens delicately balanced an unsettling combination of amusement and coldness He speaks English I asked hoping the question was unnecessary Yeah of a sort Christ It hasn't been a problem up to now You know the whole mystery man aura here isn't working for me It looks far too much like gratuitous risk Why do we need him Frazer cocked his head back slightly By all appearance it was a gesture designed to signal a radical lack of interest even mild contempt Adaptability Mental flexibility I don't know It's your call I looked at the photo again and sighed Okay what the hell There wasn't enough information here to support a sound decision The company had seen all these files and green-lighted the crew Why complicate things I deleted all the documents It was what it was The Qasm SUV had a kill-cradle for the tablet After a perfunctory check I placed mine inside and pressed the wipe button Really commented Frazer who'd been watching the process It's in the contract No communication or information-storage devices to be taken on board I recited from memory But nothing about extinguishing all related data Habit He shrugged That was all he was going to get and he knew it He switched tack Do they have some superstitious objection to the thirteenth Terra firma was burning the soles of his feet He wanted us to be already underway but that wasn't the way Qasm understood time No And they don't care about St Valentine's Day either Everybody's here That was true The other crew members were lodged in a small hotel on the bluff There's a schedule I said It shouldn't have been necessary We had another twelve hours to kill Nothing was going to erode and then eliminate any of them except tolerated duration A subtle tremor of resignation passed through him Loss of control was something he already knew about but that didn't mean he had to like it 05 Nestled into the cliff close to the dock was a small atmospheric bar called The Crab Pot The name made it sound like a restaurant but the little food that was served there looked inedible It had settled itself confidently upon the sharp cusp between authenticity and simulation This was the kind of place a million bars around the world wanted to be but since it grasped the fact whatever innocence it might once have had was now gone It had adjusted itself neatly to its own stereotype with netting and crab traps complicating a softly-illuminated cave-like interior unsullied by audiovisual technology There wasn't even a jukebox Dock hands and tourists patronized it in roughly comparable numbers Even at midday it was half-full Most of the patrons were clustered around the bar laconically swapping jokes and sea stories The dark rum which everyone already seemed to be drinking looked good We ordered two coffees which weren't terrible The periphery was mostly empty It was easy to find a quiet corner So the company Frazer began The formless stub of a question was already tilting forward towards the cargo That was understandable Realizing that frontal engagement was futile he had set out now upon a more patient and indirect route although it was nowhere close to being indirect enough I sipped at my coffee waited Thing is he continued in a slow cautious drawl I've no idea what QASM stands for what it is or what it does It's strangely difficult to find out I'm assuming it's a business with customers but if so it's not exactly broadcasting the fact Say I wanted to buy something from them You don't On the web the company says it's selling deep technology solutions he persisted Okay that sounds like a business like marketing spin but it isn't really telling me anything at all This is coming up now It wasn't at all where I wanted our conversation to be I'd somehow imagined he would know that First chance I've had to raise the question In person It's not exactly email material I let that pass The communication channel wasn't going to matter a damn to this stuff There was what could be said and what couldn't A meatspace encounter made no difference to any of it Let's take a step back Regression wasn't really the direction to be followed because progression wasn't an option on this map We weren't going anywhere with this Rather it seemed necessary to move the conversation sideways into a more realistic context What I do for Qasm what they pay me for has a lot to do with not asking questions It's a professional ethos Or exactly the opposite whichever you prefer They contract me to make problems disappear So you can see how this mission slots into that I'm sure Crucially doing nothing ever that could contribute to their information risks is where it begins You'd rather not know he summarized at an angle He seemed genuinely curious rather than judgmental It's my job not to know And you're okay with that It's what I do So interrogating you further would be completely pointless That is the only point Yeah I'm beginning to get it He even smiled but only a little and only for an instant They're putting you on the boat to keep me in the dark You know that's probably true but they'd never tell me and I'd never ask He shrugged not quite amused but not conspicuously annoyed by my flippancy either I had no idea how much money he was going to make for the next three weeks of work but it had to be abnormal He was being paid for acceptance in the absence of understanding We all were 06 The cargo had been pre-installed within a technologicallysophisticated closed unit whose design had followed a smooth asymptotic curve to the edge of the absolute It was like the Pythoness herself but to a higher power Upon arrival at the destination as confirmed by the inbuilt satellite navigation system my responsibility was to enter the activation code and initiate the release sequence Three weeks on a boat for nine keystrokes After a ninety-second delay the thing we were transporting would then be dropped into the earth's deepest submarine abyss Execution of this simple task would be the culmination of the mission completely exhausting whatever meaning it might have In any case by the end we'd probably still have learnt next to nothing about it The cargo disposal unit occupied a compartment situated below deck and accessed from the main cabin that doubled-up as a compact storage bay and workshop encroached upon by the fuel tanks and engine cowlings The entire crew could fit inside but it was a crush There was no way more than two people would have been able to do anything productive there at a time The unit was located on the port side of the compartment balanced by two of the three fuel tanks Its containment sheath was a seamless polycarbon shell perfectly rigid yet peculiarly neutral in tactile quality It had no color at all The matt black substance was so unreflective it appeared almost as a hole in space The sensible absence tempted me to touch it again and it still felt like a hardened vaguely repulsive void Nobody else wanted to make any kind of contact with it whatsoever We stood crammed together in silence for a moment as if absorbing its imperceptible tense hush It wasn't quite coffin-shaped but to an overactive imagination it might have suggested the casket for an alien child So that's it Frazer said eventually Not much to look at Scruggs added perhaps as a dry joke I carefully examined the faces of my four companions one by one trying to extract what I could about their initial responses to our task No one was transparently thrilled but beyond that it was difficult to say Frazer looked quietly determined folded into himself in a way I already suspected was typical He was adapting to a situation that was not in the slightest degree responsive to any of our wishes Scruggs might have been silently praying his lips moving scarcely perceptibly Other than that he seemed calm enough or at least accepting Zodh was smiling cryptically unreadable It fell upon Bolton to represent everyone's doubts What do you think is in there he asked He wasn't making any effort to hide his disquiet Do you care answered Frazer In less than a day he'd already passed surreptitiouly into a miniature occult circle It was now his unreflective instinct to preserve the integrity of the unknown against encroachment I would have smiled if I had thought even for a moment that he might not notice Sure I care Bolton responded irritably It could be anything I mean if it isn't hazardous why is it locked away from us like this No one said This is the job Frazer interrupted If you have problems with it you've still got he looked at his watch an hour and seventeen minutes in which to quit Bale out now and you might avoid being sued for breach of contract Bolton scowled but said nothing Like the rest of the crew he was being paid enough to cover a lot of unhappiness Frazer passed me a strange sideways glance Silencing Bolton didn't mean he had no questions of his own and they'd be back His support had been strictly tactical The silent communication didn't compromise my gratitude One step at a time was alright with me It had to be 07 We set out into calm miserable weather The wind was no more than a breeze but its icy teeth were wounding Chill mist tending to drizzle that never quite fell deepened the elusiveness of a dull gray sky According to all primitive intuition we were heading on a meaningless course into formless infinity Our prospects were awesome in their uninterrupted obscurity For an hour or so we stood each apart scattered along the guardrail No one spoke The coast behind us gradually receded into invisibility The steady thrum of the engine smoothed further as it withdrew into the subliminal constancy of an auditory ground-state Like insects we were now hearing it through our feet Eventually Bolton broke the silence So it begins he said His tone of voice in its dull vacancy was a sonic translation of the sky-shades Leaden perhaps with heavy vagueness muffling an encroaching blackness It alluded to storms rather than announcing one Still there would be a storm Thy Will be done Scruggs added speaking into the nebulous oblivion On Earth as it is in Heaven It was hard to know which seemed more distant Limbo had never meant anything to me before Now it was palpable Zommoddybpskhattao Zodh contributed solemnly Each alien syllable was slowly and precisely intoned His gaze was rigidly locked onto the horizon where he was seeing something nobody else did Zommo he repeated with still deeper languid sonorousness You open the Old Way You close Great Gates of Sleep What the fuck Bolton mumbled softly aghast at what his simple remark had avalanched into as it passed like a stray wave down the relay chain Scruggs edged towards him and away from Zodh back along the guardrail They exchanged glances wordlessly communicating some message I was unable to interpret and didn't want to guess at Frazer had already left I now noticed I'd missed him slip away How much of this had he caught His absence spoke if elliptically No complex stuff he had said I came close to laughing at that now Was he on drugs howled some nagging hallucinated jester It doesn't matter because he will be soon enough Backstage a clown chorus snickered in appreciation Since Full-Stop had crashed the mind smurfs had become noisier but they would be easy enough to ignore The cold was already killing them I suspected The ocean would finish it Bolton and Scruggs left the deck together exchanging a few awkward words Zodh pushed further into his raptures I watched for a while but eventually my attention was vacuumed back out to the empty horizon It fused into hazed memories of other journeys associated intimately through nothing but their common indefiniteness None of them had been anything in themselves or at least anything that could be recalled other than cloudy allusions to alternative voyages each fading into its own immemorability They had been dreams probably or stories encountered long ago Muffled echoes vividly indistinct returned from some freezing fogbank of forgetting Out there somewhere was recall It would all come back in its own time or not It made no difference Ahead of us lay a pre-set course towards some absolute annihilation of purpose We were getting rid of something When it was done we still wouldn't know what it had been Something over 5000 nautical miles away West South-West our destination simmered in the distant tropics The lazy curve of our route had been plotted to miss out everything in between The cargo was to be released into the Challenger Deep where the Mariana Trench lurched down into its nethermost extremity It came to its end in the Western Pacific 210 miles South-West of Guam 08 No one said much On the one topic worthy of discussion there was nothing to be said Already it seemed the crew had come to think of me as an additional layer of shielding strategically placed between them and the object of their morbid fascination They understood that I had not been set among them to clarify their near-term fate but far more nearly the opposite If they had questions about what lay in store for them I would be the last one to hear them The distance made observation easier The boat was too small for them to withdraw themselves from my attention without continuous effort They were bottled specimens within convenient visual and auditory range There was no need to expend energy pursuing them Like a spider or something far less common but still spider-like it was sufficient to quietly wait for my prey to appear Even if time was to be an enemy of unknown potency space was on my side Scruggs who had already singled himself out by the intensity of his aversion to my presence was also the easiest to catch When he stumbled upon me his pride kept him from the path of immediate retreat He wanted to communicate his defiance and animosity along with his refusal to acknowledge any right on my part to a piece of the boat's limited space This territorial obstinacy continually lured him into the dissectionzone Perhaps initially he imagined I would shift out of his way randomly displaced by discomfort Instead I smiled emptily at him before returning to what I pretended were consuming private thoughts That was a torment to him and he handled it badly He fed me every day It was difficult not to admire him however distantly He'd pulled himself out of a trajectory that had touched the edge of a black-hole If not quite a breakage of fate it looked much the same from outside He was human gristle that the world had been forced to spit out Scruggs was inseparable from his King James Bible a grim leather-bound volume that had been pored over or pawed through to the edge of disintegration On the rare occasions when it wasn't in his hands he kept it in a black canvas pouch that seemed to have been specially designed for the purpose He spent a lot of time praying His religiosity wasn't quite exhibitionistic but it was so entirely lacking in inhibitory selfconsciousness that it might as well have been It was to whatever he'd found in this book that he owed his difference from zero There was no way he could hide his gratitude for that There was something mustily glorious about it a fragment of grim seventeenth century piety re-animated as a twenty-first century sport of nature Steer us each day closer to the course of your Will Lord he mumbled softly Help us to bind more tightly the evil in our hearts In the name of the Father and the Son and the Spirit that glides across the great water shelter these wretched sinners from the storm of your wrath He stared at me intently as he said this and much else like it I smiled back After a couple of days had passed I took it up a notch Scruggy I said as he passed knowing the stupid nickname would annoy him Scruggs he shot back automatically You have a moment No But he'd paused instinctively I was hoping to borrow your Bible just for an hour or two if you're not looking at it right now His arrested stroll transitioned into full paralysis I had been tweaking the barbed hook for thirty minutes or so before deploying it For a few seconds I indulged myself in smug recognition of its genius Once it had sunk in the inter-angled acuities made it impossible to wriggle from without it digging in further from another direction Why he managed eventually Why read the Bible The distorted echo could only have been maddening He glowered arms folded across his chest defensively Yet beneath the infuriation I could see something else the thing I was counting on obliging him crushingly to share the Word The abyss I said and then as if in painstaking explanation to an idiot I want to see what it says about the abyss He pulled out the book This is a King James he said It never uses the word It isn't the word that matters The deep the bottomless pit the abode of demons he guessed That's what you're after Was the ambivalence deliberate If so it was impressive His face betrayed no guile What I'm after I repeated as a test What you're looking for The displacement clarified nothing Why do you care About what's in there I gestured towards the book tugging again on the initial request twisting the hook still deeper into the neuralgic zone of his conflicted possessiveness You don't think it has anything to tell us about where we're going You don't care about what's in here he snapped succumbing to his hostility About what's inside Tugging again slowly It's not inside You think I disagree He turned to leave dazed with vague rage Come on Scuggs I asked again The book Just for an hour He froze once more turned back twisting on the line He couldn't lend it to me He couldn't not It's okay I said letting it go Later Weeks stretched ahead He had nowhere to flee 09 A blind spot is a hole in perception that conceals itself It's the thing you don't see The cargo the thought of the cargo was like that It was perfectly hidden in every normal respect Yet in some other and excessive dimension it loomed It was impossible to contemplate directly and perhaps even indirectly but it overshadowed everything Oppressively close yet absolutely elsewhere it intimately engaged with us on terms that were not ours It enveloped our thoughts and words even our movements We were caught in its absolutely ungraspable proximity as if in a subtle web It had not occurred to me that it could be anything we might understand That was a pre-emptive defense mechanism I had already begun to recognize Otherwise the tantalization would have been intolerable consuming all thought without remainder None of my crewmates were as well protected It sucked upon them I had brought nothing to read and could no longer understand why How had I thought I was going to divert myself It was already hard to remember Even if there was more time to kill than I could have expected that had already been plenty 350 hours or so by any reasonable guess It wasn't going to conveniently compress itself Still there were threads of recollection to tug at Guarding the cargo was to have been the time sink I had assumed it would be a serious matter requiring continuous vigilance even something akin to patrolling or aggressive reconaissance although of a subtle variety Deliberate diversion hadn't been a consideration It would have been like taking a fat beach-holiday novel to a competitive chess match but then the match had in some still indefinite sense been cancelled There was a gaping unexpected hole which the containment unit echoed unilluminously Spare time wasn't anything familiar professionally speaking I had become habituated to continuous acceleration to an extent that I only now clearly acknowledged Up to this point there had always been a little more complexity in a little less time Full-Stop the last job had been especially difficult There had been too many moving parts and too many players It had begun smoothly enough but it had ended with crawling about in the dark knives gunfire and screaming It had also involved a boat though it had not set out to sea By the end it had been a floating morgue Under such conditions and beyond very strict limits redundancy was slackness to be excised I had been unprepared for our new micro-universe where superfluity was enthroned without challenge Bolton had tilted the other way He had brought three substantial volumes with him on our voyage The first was a densely-technical analysis of memristor architecture the second a somewhat more discursive but still imposingly-mathematical introduction to holographic universe cosmology His third book was of far greater obvious relevance to our undertaking He lent it to me without reluctance perhaps anticipating a modestly informed conversation in the days ahead The book was an introduction to hydrothermal vent eco-systems what it called dark ecologies It wasn't especially impenetrable easy reading for Bolton I guessed so I was able to partially digest its contents over the few hours of the loan Life without light was the theme Since the topic wasn't anything I had turned my mind to before it was enlightening from the start Anaerobic bacteria were the constructors In the absence of sunlight the extremophile-based ecologies of the ocean depths fueled themselves by extracting usable energy from heat methane and sulfur compounds through chemosynthesis This produced the foundations of a food-chain Insofar as terrestrial biology was concerned this was the Old Road The sun was nothing to the denizens of the abyss except a geochemical legacy and a distant invisible mass It would have been dream fuel if there had still been dreams Active hydrothermal vents are thought to exist on some of the gas giant moons Bolton said On Jupiter's Europa probably and Saturn's Enceladus There have even been scientific speculations that ancient hydrothermal vents once existed on Mars This place we're going I asked Bolton It has this night life Sure he replied A long way down It's not as if we're going to see any of this stuff No I agreed But it's there 10 The Pythoness was so highly automated it was basically a robot There wasn't much for any of us to do Frazer was the only one of us to be badly affected by that initially and in any obvious way He drifted around the vessel in a state of unsuppressed agitation his senses straining for anything that could absorb his attention Every half hour or so he re-visited the bridge scrupulously checked the computer monitors tried to find some point of insertion for expert human judgment and failed Then he returned to the deck to prowl around moodily intermittently gazing out into the gray confusion of sea and sky His sense of frustrated obligation was palpable The three others appeared undisturbed by the inescapable idleness which worried me more What The Pythoness was inflicting upon us the basic thing here was time glut If it wasn't a mistake it was worse To leave the crew so unoccupied was an invitation to chaos Eventually this compulsory liberation from the constraints of practical routine would turn into something For an hour or so I amused myself with thoughts of pointless duties and diversions that could be invented and wondered but only vaguely and momentarily whether it was something I should try to throw myself into The idea was deeply unrealistic Even were I capable of inventing plausible tasks to mop up everyone's time I had no authority to impose them Frazer alone could do that Besides it was already far too late to begin now The situation was set Directionless self-entertainment would be no real substitute for a sense of purpose not for long The Pythoness was a time bomb She was far too self-contained but it didn't end there Whatever she could not do herself could be done instead remotely from the Port Sidon Qasm facility The final abolition of our practical relevance took the form of the snakes Qasm had decided upon the name which made enough sense to stick with There were two Each was an extendable tele-control cable with a multifunctional tool-head One would have been plenty but pairing them was another example of redundant design There was one located on the port side of the upper bridge another on the starboard side but either was capable of reaching any place on the boat We didn't see much of them for the first few days Nihilism is nothing but too much time Brad Miller had said as Full-Stop was going south When people without enough to do begin to look for something that's when the problems begin That was roughly 36-hours before he was tortured to death in a sound-proofed San Francisco basement by Robert Philcarius The Entertainer whose Morons Law anarchist hacker-cult had trojaned itself into the Qasm servers for kicks It was another two days before I found the body and by then it had begun to smell bad Full-Stop for Brad the clowns had laughed Eight of the Morons died three very horribly before it was clear there was nothing behind the prank The outcome was acceptable in Qasm's estimation After that it no longer felt as if I was being over-paid I didn't at that point expect anything like Philcarius-style fullspectrum insanity to afflict us out here but what would occupy our time The question became more intriguing when reversed Why had a crew been needed at all Might sheer institutional inertia have accounted for it That was certainly conceivable But if one man even two had been considered prudent as security against contingencies why five Our redundancy was so extravagant it was impossible to ignore This was a mission demanding next to nothing from any of us It was a social experiment even if an accidental one There would still have been an explosive adundance of time if it had been neatly disintegrated by sleep but that isn't what happened What happened was the other thing 11 It would have been possible no doubt to select five men less inclined to the bonds of mutual companionship but it would not have been easy Between each of us and every other stood formidable walls of incomprehension and actually latent antagonism The only thing we shared was disconnection Three weeks without Internet had begun and nobody had yet mentioned it Clearly none of my companions were connective types I had to remind myself that these four had worked together before more than once The acknowledgement was instantly amusing They had all immediately disappeared almost entirely into themselves Frazer was lost in the solitude of command Bolton in his technical calculations Scruggs in the mysteries of prayer and Zodh in whatever heathenish horrors seethed secretly in his brain None had any solid ground for communion with any of his fellows They were all following separate paths that led only inward The intimacy with the sea which they did hold in common only distanced them further from each other The Pacific they crossed was not a place of contact or commercial intercourse but for each a very different essentially incommunicable thing I could already make out the rough outlines For Frazer it was a challenge for Bolton an insulator and for Scruggs a prospect of final redemption A gradual erosion of motivation gnawed upon all three Zodh was the outlier Alone among the crew his sense of purpose was in no obvious way attenuated If anything it seemed peculiarly intensified screwed up to a wild and alien pitch The behavior through which it manifested itself was initially unintelligible He spent six-hour blocks of time in swirling motion The overall tendency of his meanderings was a counter-clockwise circumambulation of The Pythoness in slow gyrations whose consistency emerged from a turbulence of sub-loops and gestural complexities He appeared to be in the early stage of some artistic or architectural endeavour encompassing the entire vessel At first I suspected he was engaged in a process of measurement since at certain points he stopped dead in his tracks as if to mentally digest the completion of some arcane metric unit Gradually however these moments of concentration resolved themselves into the performance of a ritual Pits- Drop Pits-Drop he repeated over and over exploring the syllables summoning something through them After the first hundred micro-cycles of the chant it had become indistinguishable from a dull headache I tuned it out to the best of my ability Hey Zodh I called out softly but distinctly as a test He ignored me as I had guessed he would I let it go There was time 12 Do you kill people for a living asked an unrecognized voice highpitched and sarcastic Is that what you do It was jarringly textured and extravagantly vital in a way that was only possible for something that had never been alive The jolt of synthetic animation induced queasiness Memories are best eaten dead I turned around automatically but no one was there It wasn't that I had expected there to be upon even split-second cursory reflection The absence was a confirmation rather than a surprise Almost certainly it was an auditory phantasm woven opportunistically into atmospheric noise Such verbal apparitions were not unfamiliar to me or even particularly mysterious voices that were not quite thoughts but which guided thought to intolerable destinations They were advance symptoms of psychological dissociation and probably no more than an indication of gathering sleeploss craziness in this case Still distractions I had seen vicariously could be death-traps It would be necessary to keep a tight grip on them 13 Nothing is hazardous without time without the opportunity for things to happen In any game when estimating the menace posed by the enemy one asks how much time do they have Who was the enemy here I wasn't ready to assume that we lacked one Zodh was attempting to teach Bolton and Scruggs a card game It was something he'd picked up from fishermen in the Sunda Strait according to the tale he was weaving in hideously broken English around the edge of the demonstration The cards were bets or beasts it was hard to tell lashed together by elementary arithmetic I tried to get some sense of the rules while pretending to pay no attention After perhaps a quarter of an hour of such lurking the impression I had gathered was only barely compatible with the diversion being a game at all It appeared to be far less about winning or losing in any conventional sense than about something else entirely and whatever that was neither Bolton nor Scruggs seemed to have any greater purchase upon it than I did Zodh was being drawn ever deeper into the cryptic circulation of the cards but Scruggs and Bolton had been lost along the way Scruggs gave up first muttering something I couldn't catch and then drifting off directionlessly Bolton followed a couple of minutes later Zodh seemed scarcely to notice I wandered over and squatted down in what had been Scruggs place Zodh didn't notice that either I hadn't expected to extract significant pattern from the cards and I didn't It was impossible nevertheless to miss the fact that something was there It was an abstract engine Some kind of sub-decimal fusion process drove flakes of fate around a central three-phase circuit in a turbular cascade After perhaps twenty minutes Zodh looked up at and through me Storm coming he said without discernible affect 14 Mid-afternoon on the third day with nothing obvious to do it occurred to me that it would make sense to try and catch up on missed sleep No one would miss me or anybody else It wasn't that I felt particularly tired even after a succession of nights that had seemed completely sleepless The feeling of detachment had persisted toppling over at times into an impression of general unreality but there was still no suggestion whatsoever of an inclination to unconsciousness I went below deck took off my shoes clambered up into my bunk and lay on my back Closing my eyes shut down far less awareness than it was meant to Indeterminate thoughts ground like restless gears After perhaps fifteen minutes I gave up climbed down from the bunk put my shoes on and went back outside It was a little after half-past three in the afternoon local time The sea and sky were still bleak and indistinct Our distance from the destination had to be shrinking steadily but there was no corresponding intuition Motion had resolved itself into a changeless condition without any frame of reference The Pacific was the closest thing to a terrestrial image of endlessness a vastness released reluctantly from some small fraction of the horizon There was nothing to compare it to It defied estimation even relative to itself Contemplation of the unbounded sea and sky was unsettling after a while Each was interrupted only by the other in a shimmering remoteness of uncertain definition The continuous flight of the horizon from apprehension into a line at once attractive and intangible was psychologically exhausting When exposed to those untrammeled magnitudes for too long the mind ached from over-stretch The cargo containment unit called silently so I went to it There was at least one absolute non-event in the universe It was absorbing beyond all reason After some time the door opened and closed behind me It was Bolton The Captain sent me he said I nodded uninterestedly He wanted to know what you were doing This deserved less than a nod It was pointless irritation There's a camera He pointed to the mechanical eye in the corner It feeds to the local core in the bridge You've been standing here for over an hour just staring at it At what At He broke off and looked again long enough to remember there was nothing to see The absence pulled at him until he turned away From certain very specific angles the merest hint of reflectivity swam up out of the blackness hinting remotely at shadows Perhaps he could catch some cryptic trace of his drowned image cast down into the gulf of obliteration It was unlikely though The scraps of escaping light had been chewed into abstraction by some buried turbular agitation So what are you doing here he pressed Watching over it Doing my job You're expecting it to move It was probably intended as a humorous remark I don't like it he added in a smaller voice This I asked unnecessarily with a minimalistic gesture into the encapsulating void What's not to like Then with a little less flippancy It's a box I guess He turned to go pausing at the hatch You're staying here For a while 15 Each night was the same Descent into unconsciousness was impossible I was trapped at the surface of awareness as if by some stubborn positive buoyancy With each downward struggle the imposition of sentience seemed if anything to intensify The sleeplessness of previous nights had long ceased to be dismissable as an aberration It was the way things were now an architectural component of out shrunken world After an hour or so I abandoned the pointless trial and climbed out of my berth as quietly as possible The consideration was unnecessary Nobody was sleeping Only Zodh still lay in his bunk He was fully dressed and uncovered flat on his back with his eyes wide open His lips I thought were breathlessly animated If some whisper was emerging however I could not hear any of it Rather than hallucinate random utterances into the sonic vacancy I turned away to look around the cabin Bolton and Scruggs sat side by side on the horseshoe as if positioned for a conversation that was not taking place Their exhaustion was so palpable it seemed to sit beside and between them Frazer came in from outside He looked a lot worse than I felt Even in the gloom of the cabin it was easy to see that his eyes were bloodshot and recessed among dark rings as if sunk deep into folds of heavy bruising You look like crap I told him He squinted at me grumpily Just one more week I said Yeah he grunted If the weather doesn't deteriorate any further Coffee ready Like everything else on The Pythoness caffeine provision was an automated function We'd set the allocation schedule within hours of setting out and had since found no pressing reason to change it To seize upon the option to re-set the coffee machine as a chance to assert our residual autonomy would have been too degrading to bear Do you know what we have in the medical locker I asked him You think there might be something in there for sleep prevention He regarded me quizzically How is sleep prevention in any way the problem we have But he was already getting it If we were going to be imprisoned in sleeplessness it made sense to sharpen the condition That would mean taking a dubious journey to its end but our choices in that regard were in any case brutally constrained It has to be worth a look doesn't it Yeah okay he agreed without further resistance We pulled out the medicine chest and emptied it methodically onto the floor Bandages went into one pile surgical instruments into another When the first stage was complete and the pharmaceuticals had been isolated we returned everything else to the chest in tolerable order Sorting out the drugs was only a little more complicated Everything was neatly labeled Is this what we want Frazer asked after only a few seconds of sieving It only took a quick look I nodded There were three packets each containing two foil and bubble-sealed sheets of 24 capsules It was called Zommodrine What the hell is that he muttered I had never heard of the substance before either The label included a warning not to consume more than three tablets within any 24-hour period noting the additional risks for those with high blood-pressure or heart conditions and then in large dramatically emphasized type prolonged sleep deprivation can produce a range of serious physical and psychological effects This was totally our stuff We should dish it out I suggested He was less sure Do we know what we're doing he asked I ignored the absurd question and went to fetch a cup of water Dosage instructions were hazy so I popped two of the plastic blisters downing the green-and-black caps I've got stuff to do I said 16 A few hours later Frazer stepped in to the machine room His pupils were fully-dilated which had to be the zommodrine How did I guess you'd be here The sarcasm was grating pointlessly abusive It's not a large boat He stared just for a moment into the compact nothingness The he pulled a scrap of yellow carbon-copy paper from his pocket and held it up Where did you get that I asked Does it matter I guess not Laboratory waste he recited from the manifest by memory as he waved it at me What the fuck is that You ask too many questions I said It's annoying you You're not interested There was a hard edge to the question which glinted with more unrefined hostility than I had noticed before We've done that You think He paused just for a second Why are you here Symns Really Talking to you now On this boat I thought about it again I'm not sure I admitted Why are any of us here Bolton is a serene nihilist he responded at a tangent He fills his free time with equations endlessly reformulating zero I wouldn't call that prayer not usually but I will now Scruggs prays every spare moment the old way Even Zodh prays almost ceaselessly to whatever hoodoo hideousnesses he thinks might be noticing And then there's you You come here The machine room was a quiet place to be alone in but I didn't want to help him make his point So what do you pray to Frazer I asked instead We stood together staring at the near-perfect patch of blackness as if before a self-concealing shrine to negative existence Do you want to open it he asked eventually You mean force it open The thought hadn't occurred to me unless at the most subliminal level It had simply seemed impossible It was impossible Christ no We could ditch it now he suggested with an eagerness rooted more in brain-stem chemistry than reflection The idea was of course instantly appealing but only for that half-second of mental inertia before the cognitive machinery re-engaged practicalities Then it reverted to transparent senselessness Two problems I said Start with mechanics The release control has a GPS lock Activation permission is rigidly location-dependent So we don't really get to the second problem although it goes a lot deeper The company thinks this thing whatever the fuck it is belongs in an ocean trench I can only assume they have good reasons for that Why did this become our problem Frazer asked Even his current state of profound psychological erosion had failed to subvert his inner toughness still expressed through his frame and bearing so it was disappointing to see him now switching to a tack this pathetic Countless hours of decompression could only have taught him patience but to be caged in an enforced vacation among unexorcized command responsibilities was different The absence of any opportunity for action was a torture for him It had brought him this low if only momentarily He had arrived at his moral nadir I stared at him coldly It is our problem There was simply no denying it and he didn't try After permitting him a few more seconds of silent submission to reality I continued Unless we get this boat to the right coordinates there's no separating ourselves from whatever that thing is He was struggling to pull himself together against the undertow of sleep starvation Crucially he was ashamed even though he would never be able to admit it Seeing his spiritual collapse arrested I permitted myself a thin smile How confident are you that there's anything inside at all he asked after a while This was a new twist There was a grain of coarse genius to the question If he was testing me it was merely cunning but I heard something else He was exploring an inner horizon Why would Qasm pay us to do nothing I parried fully confident he wouldn't know or even try to guess Why would they do any of this shit He was back I smiled sympathetically We'll think about it okay A week to go 17 All four of them were squatting together on the deck the parasitic micro-community of The Pythoness gathered in a tight cluster It would almost have composed a semi-circle arranged around Frazer if not for Zodh who somehow strayed out beyond its natural boundary A meeting I asked pointedly Since the gathering could hardly have occurred spontaneously it vividly exhibited my exclusion from the crew I was an unknown factor set firmly outside the central communication loop by a wall of structural suspicion The point was too obvious for anyone to mention Nobody tried to hide or deny it Frazer looked up as I approached his expression unreadable No one has slept he said Not since we set out How sure are you Quite sure he said Unless somebody is lying The last words were marked by a tone of contemptuous dismissal You don't think anybody is lying I asked inclined to awkwardness Frazer refused the bait Not about this He paused before resuming more aggressively his stare boring into me carbonized to blackness by implicit accusation Why would they Confusion stupidity fear You're not wanted here Symns Scruggs interrupted Scram We're talking I ignored him If the topic of their discussion mattered at all it mattered to me The cargo the insomnia they're one thing aren't they Frazer asked me as if I might know Despite the profound suspicion built into the words his tone had shifted becoming more conciliatory as if implicitly snubbing Scruggs demand for my expulsion I could only throw up my hands refusing commitment The hypothesis was roughly plausible but nothing more So whatever it is it's keeping us awake Frazer pushed on We don't know that I objected He scowled So what do we know Bolton and Scruggs edged even closer to him as if to physically reinforce his question Their adamant solidarity was a provocation Forget sleep for a moment How's memory working for you guys I probed They exchanged glances blankly Let's assume you're right and everyone here has been sleepstripped for a week now That's 170 hours of continuous awareness roughly speaking Think of it as a dilating consciousness bubble stretching ever thinner What do you remember from before that You could start with something easy like the eleventh of February Encouraged by gathering signs of uneasiness I pushed further Or how about the last dream you can recall Who remembers dreams Bolton objected They're designed to erase themselves I remember them Scruggs dissented drawn in despite himself Usually But not recently I asked pressing my advantage No he accepted The most recent dreams I could remember had been about sleep I had been surprised they could exist on the assumption that dreams were a place for unconsciousness to hide itself Perhaps they were fake recollections It's supposed to be impossible to die in a dream isn't it I asked diagonally Does anyone still believe that There were dreams I never had Scruggs said cutting across me Instead As a disruption gambit it was the worst move he could have made This was the admission I had been waiting for Yet to have my tentative speculations confirmed so smoothly was deeply troubling in a way I had not foreseen Peversely I was tempted to challenge him Perhaps it isn't what you think His mind was finally in its own place and the words poured out in a torrent There was no light only burning darkness he began It was a realm of total blindness and yet it could be vividly crushingly sensed The foundations of the earth were being ripped apart and from that ceaseless Titanic ruin the great city rose its towers blacker still than the eternal night smoking pyres of endless sacrifice without meaning or limit seething with abominations Gravity had been extinguished until there was only pressure and the taste of constant incineration From beneath the absolute silence ground upwards from depths below absymal depths an immense rumbling din crashed through the dense medium in shattering waves He turned to Bolton That's what it's like down there isn't it Everyone retreated into silence until Scruggs spoke up again Yes he said as if to an unasked question I thought it was some place else Hell Frazer guessed Scruggs visibly prickled in anticipation of an attack that didn't come It's hellish enough Frazer continued the placation judged to near-perfection But what has it to do with us This isn't a diving expedition Nobody is going down there Unless it's coming up to us Scruggs muttered And we're dropping something into it Bolton added Do you guys always take dreams this seriously I asked Except it isn't a dream Bolton countered No one has been sleeping So what is it then I pressed further This was the place I had wanted to take us Now we were here I'd lost all sense of what came next Don't you see It's the obstacle he said The barrier I could make no sense of the statement and looked around to see if anyone else was following No one seemed to be Would it necessarily be so horrible to sleep Bolton continued To everyone other than himself it was a question that came from nowhere out of the gray Time spinning uselessly on stripped gears You think that's the problem I replied inattentively Nothing seemed more obvious to me than the irrelevance of this line of inquiry Bolton ignored me and turned towards Scruggs an easier mark We could take turns he insisted clutching desperately Monitor each other Set up a shift system Break through the wall of fear Christ I mumbled in disgust Bolton fidgeted shiftily If he believed his own bullshit he was hiding it well It could work he said Think about it It has to be this Assume just for comedy's sake that having someone holding your hand is going to get you across the sleep barrier I growled infuriated that we were wasting words on the suggestion How many minutes before you wake screaming in terror How much refreshing sleep do you expect to get Or do we escalate to lullabies You finished Frazer asked It was clear to me from his tone that he knew what I'd said had been necessary even if ideally communicated with less harshness Bolton looked as if he was close to tears but I could tell that his moment of grasping at childish hopes was done Okay he said softly rocking slightly Okay It seemed like the right moment to leave 18 The door opened and Frazer stepped in Here again he noted In the dark There's somewhere else I should be The absence reached out to touch him held him for a while Is it because it kills time he asked It wasn't a hostile question but I didn't really understand what he was saying If he'd described the cargo as a time-breeder it would have made no less sense Does it was the best response I could manage He started to place his hand on the casing then stopped and withdrew it I wanted to ask him why he was there but it was impossible to formulate the question neutrally His presence was irritating Concentration had become impractical I would have left but that would have said too much We stood in awkward silence beside it It's not a shrine he said after a while It's neatly-wrapped trash You know that Why do you care Care what it is Care what I think it is You want to know he asked Really I nodded without particular sincerity We have some trust stuff to work though here We do The topic shouldn't have surprised me and didn't much but for some reason the timing did You represent the company Sure I conceded Approximately It wasn't something I'd really considered for a while Out here wrapped in the boundless emptiness of the Pacific Qasm seemed very far away Once mentioned the relevance of my employment contract was undeniable When I tried to mentally pull up the details it came back in multiple versions The fragmentation had to be some kind of security ploy I'd settled upon earlier then deliberately de-memorized but now it seemed odd Frazer and the others would most probably have been somewhere out at sea even if Qasm had never heard of them They were on the Pythoness because she was a boat and that's what they did It wasn't at all like that for me I was only on the Pythoness because the company wanted me to be there for some purpose that was in no essential respect nautical The question was why From Frazer's perspective it had to be a concern I've no idea what's in there I said skipping the conversation forward by several predictable steps Yeah I believe you he accepted That's not my central concern The question I have to ask you is this what's your level of commitment to this mission The stilted formality with its display of social awkwardness diverted into linguistic convolution would have been amusing under alternative circumstances Right now it was merely another layer of irritation Would I get us all killed in an attempt to reach the objective I translated Something like that It was a good question and surprisingly hard to think through to the end Crucially there was a near-perfect match between the company's operational interests and my crystallizing inclinations It was undeniable when examined that the conclusions I'd reached about the best way to proceed coincided precisely with the instructions I'd received From outside that had to look strange and even sinister It wouldn't take any peculiarly extravagant leap of paranoid speculation to see something ominous there I wasn't sure that I didn't see it myself If I was being played it would have to look much the same in every detail There was a geometrical crash-site of obvious angles that remained unexplored but my belated attempts to rectify the neglect were already becoming increasingly difficult Exhaustion had reduced thought to a soggy crawl Logical steps slipped backwards in the sludge Each beginning over was executed more incompetently than the last I don't trust the company I tried hoping the words would drag thought after them It sounded evasive even to me It pays me what it does so that I don't have to trust it That's business But I do have to be able to trust you Otherwise there's no sleep There's no sleep anyway he grumbled Unless Unless what Unless we're thinking about it the wrong way It had taken a while to occur to me When it did eventually arriving in a kind of non-dream it was almost as if it had always been there Shadows cast onto the deck from the rotating antenna made a shifting pattern of stripes rhythmically emerging into distinctness and then dissolving back into continuity It produced a crude diagram applicable to any number of problems Scanned from one perspective it was an oscillation It might have recorded serial alternations between a pair of complementary states such as waking and sleeping most obviously When mentally rotated the succession was parallelized It turned into a simultaneous array or a set of partitions like a row of storage lockers The flicker was hypnotic Without quite realizing when I had slipped into a fugue state and begun to think about remembering dreams that never occupied time What if sleep wasn't up ahead out of reach but concurrent alongside Perhaps it was next to us You're a boat guy I said You have to spend time thinking about compartments Sure he agreed By the end of that single soft syllable his mind had traveled somewhere opened and then re-sealed a door Isolation Containment problems Separation in space or at least something spacelike I'm not really getting this he said although I could see that he was Where is sleep he mused in confirmation That's nuts He stood up We don't have time for metaphysics We don't I needled There's a time-shortage I missed out on He was about to leave but then decided not to Soft hallucinations drew green threads around his contour sharpening into complex tangles upon his face The light hurt my eyes You're saying what he asked That we're still sleeping dreaming but in another compartment Behind a bulkhead If not that why the stray memories Scarring he suggested immediately Damage It wasn't an alternative and he knew it Okay I agreed to move things along Thing is I need to keep it out of my head he said quietly but firmly It was a horrible statement frank in its brokenness nursing black infinities You need to stop thinking about it He meant more than that I was sure but I needed to hear it spelt out I don't know It was overwhelming him Frazer was acute enough but he wasn't a philosopher At least he hadn't been That spared him from the kind of intellectual overheating Bolton was increasingly vulnerable to but it left him adrift among vague shadows You sense it though don't you The attempted intrusion It's prising open the inner seals We might not have much time whatever it looks like If we're going to get through this I insisted trawling deep into my final reserves of depleted mental clarity we're going to have to make sure we know what the hell you're talking about right now In fact the suggestion he was making had already persuaded me almost entirely There was some kind of cognitive invasion underway Whatever was happening our apprehensions were part of it Every time we got a little closer to grasping it it worked its way a little further in It wants us to think about it That was the paranoid construction I'll tell you what I think he said Whatever is in that box isn't it but only what brought it fetched it A door He nodded It makes sense doesn't it That's why they panicked They let something in From where Perhaps the dreams might have told us but they were sealed-off somewhere else and in any case by all indications unintelligible At least we both knew now what they were about even if that was nothing distinguishable from absolute obscurity itself Fuckers he spat in frustration They've fucked us so bad It would have been cruder I guessed if he'd been less exhausted My thoughts were heading in a different direction How could they possibly have imagined that this mission was any kind of solution That it the unknown visitor was going to simply be crushed down there in the abyss Where had that idea even come from There was a dark trend to these questions Whose idea was this really I was tempted to write it down before it was lost but everything was already lost Records were discouraged Very roughly what do think is in there he asked breaking into my thoughts It was that question again the only one that seriously concerned any of us and every part of it was a problem Was it in there really I seriously doubted it There was unfathomable Worse though was the suspicion that even these doubts like all of our thoughts now had been compromised at the root It was the question or the problem participating in us through our preoccupation with it Our attention fed it With each meal it dug itself deeper in It meant nothing though It was a place-holder for confusion a sign of ignorant panic There had to be another name for it None of us had the slightest idea what that might be Were you ever told about McGuffin he asked me The name drew a blank 19 The sat-nav display had something extraordinary to show us and it took no special expertise to understand what I was seeing The slow vortex seethed malignantly dominating the upper part of the screen like a vast meteorological buzz-saw It was monstrously hypnotic We're going to collide with that Frazer nodded Within the next twenty-four hours unless we change course That's something we can do You know we can't So So we have to contact the company They won't like that We have to contact the company he repeated as if to an imbecile Okay There was no point fighting it What do you want me to do You have to persuade them to restore navigational control To you Of course to me Be realistic He cut me off Now he insisted His tone pretended to an authority that we both knew didn't exist I shrugged There was no need to make an issue of that for the moment Okay I conceded once again This was part of the play something to explore Qasm had decided to put Frazer on the boat Let them argue with him It took only a few keystrokes to make the connection on a highbandwidth tight-security channel The voice at the other end was meticulously dehumanized on a female diagonal That was Qasm corporate culture Anybody who wasn't a robot was under an obligation to imitate one Is there somebody else in there with you she asked Even to admit that she already knew the exact position of eveybody on The Pythoness was apparently more than she was willing to share The captain is here There was a short delay while they processed that information Our intention to include him was the surprise factor We want him to leave I think he needs to be involved in this conversation A longer delay this time We don't understand the need for a conversation I can't argue with it so I'm arguing with you Frazer broke in It was the boat I noticed That was interesting I stepped back from the console saying nothing There was nothing to argue about but Frazer had to learn that for himself We'd submitted an evasive course correction but I knew it was going nowhere The proposed course does not conform to mission parameters Qasm predictably responded We're satisfied Pythoness is representing company objectives accurately By steering us into a super-cyclone All our data indicate that the storm is survivable You're killing us It was stated calmly as a simple matter of fact It wasn't I thought that he was convinced we would die His conviction was only that Qasm had no concern for our survival which was beyond all plausible dispute That outcome is not anticipated Qasm didn't care and didn't pretend to It was honest which was attractive to me although that wasn't a judgment to share with Frazer right now He'd probably have accepted any amount of bullshit as the price for an iota of consideration I'd half-forgotten that he didn't know them like I did This had to be a serious learning-moment for him How can an extra day matter he protested It was hard not to smile He didn't understood anything The mission schedule falls outside your domain of responsibility Captain came the robot-bitch reply without the slightest discernible hesitation Frazer wasn't the type for incontinent rage but I expected him to smash something He had no domain of responsibility Qasm had seen to that and now he was being asked to absorb the consequences without dissent I'd have handled the exchange better but still without significant difference in outcome There was no possible significant difference in outcome Pits-Drop was on automatic for a reason Frazer tensed himself to reply and stopped He cut the connection Fuckers he said We were going into the whorl Just for comparison what am I seeing here I asked drawn once again into the sat-nav display where the green monster turned It looks extremely bad Probably the worst I've ever seen he confirmed It will tear into the Philippines before the end of the week which is triggering a panic there already Before then we get it But we can cope In theory Anything we can do Beyond the obvious stow everything tightly lash everything down that could move start praying not really Okay The absence of options was a kind of relief The others know Only the basics There's more than basics Not really No Not quite a smile 20 As we passed through the storm's outer squalls the weather worsened relentlessly The Pythoness had begun to pitch heavily into the swelling waves The sun was a pale disc morbidly withdrawn As dusk drew close what had been diffuse fog thickened into something like the interior of a cloud precipitating directly around us I was feeling green and in no mood for Scruggs The foul weather didn't seem to bother him much but something else did The hum he whined It's driving me insane He was telling me I guessed because by now anything bad happening on the boat led his mind back to me There was an insectoid lack of reflection to it I scowled It never stops he added Sleeplessness had a sound or something close to one It was quite obvious what he meant by the hum Sure it might have been designated in other ways but the name worked The imprecision was unavoidable If it had really been exactly a hum it would not have had the same power of insinuation It drifted in upon a dark current of obscurity I thought that perhaps I could hear it but I wasn't sure The sound if that's what it was inhabited some periphery outside all intuition at the sub-sonic lower edge of the human auditory range There was a remoteness but of some other kind utterly unlocalizable It was not at all like a voice or like music though it evoked both distantly as irritated nerves sought to latch onto the blank carrier signal You can hear it though right he asked again No Nothing Don't lie he snarled We had begun saying that to each other a lot I smiled at him consolingly Sorry He stepped a little closer uncomfortably close Instinct urged withdrawal but I muted it recognizing that confrontation would not be so easy to avoid Back off Scruggs And if I don't There'll be a stupid fight You'll lose That would be very bad It was almost possible to sense fate arriving The whisper of death soft as a moth wing stroked the anterior regions of whatever broken god's toy played the part of his soul As the tremor of insight passed through him he flinched almost imperceptibly The climax of tension arrived and passed He took a step back then another One more all the way to the railing this time and we were out of the pressure zone Why are you protecting it he asked It You know what it is You really think that You have to You're lined up with it You nurse it Everything you do helps it His eyes sparkled with hate It was still rage more than certainty that was pushing itself through into his words I don't know what it is None of us do There's no us So why are you nagging me about it Because you know something he said admantly and repetitively This shit all of it is on you The ceaseless inconclusive antagonism was nauseating and it mingled with the lurching of the deck indissolubly The falling away of the world into ocean troughs never quite settled into a rhythm It was like a mad anti-gravity experiment that could only end in vomiting but the thin slurry of coffee and zommodrine in my guts offered no purchase to the erratic heaving So it merely gnawed sub-critically at the tossed remnants of composure It's all on God isn't it I mean that's what you have to believe So why not more prayers I'll tell you what I pray for he said stepping closer too close I pray for justice For righteous punishment Isn't that just being Confused heretics have always thought so The response surprised me Heretics sounded far too high church for Scruggs I'd imagined his forebears stoking the execution pyres of people who spoke like that It's all on God Scruggy You just don't understand what he wants 21 The last vague suggestions of distinct terrestrial existence were erased in the night The cosmos was a silent storm a stellar cyclone Zodh lay on the deck on his back gaping pupils saturated with stars Sleeplessness seemed not to affect him at all Among all of us he alone was not visibly deteriorating I watched from a distance trying to piece him together from the few fragments that I had getting nowhere The sea was ominously calm the sky heavily overcast but still It felt like a final respite I had taken three zommodrine caps half an hour before vacuuming exhaustion into some unpayable liability pushed back somewhere comfortably beyond the immediate horizon Existence was I guessed in that moment okay Then Scruggs appeared like an unwanted wraith suspending himself in my attention zone but not quite approaching There was no way to dispel his presence without engaging him and that was the last thing I wanted to do He hovered for maybe fifteen minutes saying nothing intermittently staring Finally in accordance with some inflexible private schedule he came closer You have some racist shit in your heart about Zodh he asked Totally I admitted He's a repulsive savage I don't even think he's sane No cut that I'm reluctant to categorize him as human He's my friend Sure he is It wasn't necessary to emphasize the sarcasm though I smiled a little It's because he believes in something That's why you hate him I've no idea whether he believes in anything or not and I don't hate him I don't even dislike him But that's why isn't it The stubbornness of the remark was the whole point He wasn't looking for nuance So this is about you We both knew it was If he'd had anything to say about Zodh's beliefs I would have hung upon his words The topic came second only to the cargo on my list of gripping intellectual preoccupations Scruggs in contrast didn't care He had his own inner light to follow and it was so dazzling it cast everything else into irrelevance It's about faithlessness It's about evil he said The nothingness devouring us That's your message If he's right about what he believes you're not Even the very little I understood about both told me that He ignored the divisive logic contemptuously Your wrong is deeper he said 22 Frazer didn't want to talk but I did He flitted among the screens every detail of his posture radiating an intolerance for distraction I waited silently until the pretense of productive activity had tilted over into transparent farce What can you do I asked Information without practical discretion was worthless He growled noncommittally and raked his fingers through his hair He could see there was no convincing rejoinder What is it Symns I'm worried about Scruggs We're descending into some kind of alien Hell beyond sleep A storm of truly biblical proportions is about to engulf us And you're worried about Scruggs He's going to snap I had no doubt at all that he was aware of the impending event Scruggs had been hurtling towards crisis on a parabolic curve Everyone had been keeping out of his way as if from an ignited dynamite stick Scruggs is okay he said No he's not okay The simple factuality of the statement chipped through his crust of fake delusion Frazer swallowed back the dialectical idiocy that he had been about to persevere with Alright he said What do you think he's going to do Seriously I admitted Fuck knows Something bad So what are you recommending It was more of a begging for help thing Frazer was quietly enjoying my discomfort Yeah he hates you he acknowledged Understandably When he cracks I might have to hurt him badly or worse You realize it's something I can do He registered that The next response was cautious and far more mentally-engaged Violence is part of your skill-set Not the biggest part but a part A professional competence Yes Then you'd take Scruggs I guess he acknowledged We're stuck together on this boat so it's complicated I can see that Comprehension crept in slowly He wasn't mean enough for this type of insight to come easily You're saying you'd have to kill him He was getting it Last time I looked we don't have a brig Or even handcuffs If you're asking for my permission Of course not I broke in I'm trying to explain why this is a problem And not just your problem Exactly There was a tense hiatus as he mentally digested the point reappraising me and what the mission was turning into Pits-Drop hadn't been about killing even a little bit Now he had to wonder whether perhaps it was You would wouldn't you he noted scrutinizing me carefully What the hell are you Symns I had you down as a corporate errand boy but now I'm wondering if you're some kind of hit man Why would Qasm put an assassin on a waste-disposal boat That's supposed to sound as menacing as it does No It hadn't been Professional killers have to cost don't they So why stow one here with us That's the question I'm now asking He tailed off Did you consider that we might need to protect ourselves from you Continuously He laughed There was a hint of madness in it And I'm not a professional killer I added though I had recently begun to wonder about that Far more of a freelance corporate errand boy I do deliveries The killing only happens when things go very badly wrong which they do sometimes especially recently It's not a result built-in from the start and it's not something I like When accidents occur I have to deal with them They're still accidents Prickly issue with you A little Look he said Scruggs gets into fights sometimes On shore mostly Two scraps with Zodh that I know about He even took a swing at me once which didn't work out well for him No one ever said anything about killing him over it Before I left it at that because I didn't like the way this was going anymore than he did 23 The storm was a black wall Its thrashing curtains seemed to define the boundary of creation Biblical had been Frazer's word Perhaps it might have been improved upon but I couldn't see how There was no point asking whether we were going into it We were almost there Apparently impenetrable ramparts of world-splitting gloom directly obstructed our course That we would soon all be dead was less a pessimistic prediction than a vivid intuition To envision anything except annihilating chaos lying beyond the screen far overstretched my imagination It was early afternoon at the edge of the crossing In less than an hour we would have switched over to the other side of the universe I washed down another couple of zommodrine caps with a gulp of cold coffee and waited It was just bad weather for a while polarized upon a gradient of darkness The Pythoness bucked like a whipped animal Behind us the hints of a lost sun still lingered Ahead of us lay self-swallowing night turning only into itself By coincidence Bolton had derided the description of tempest waves as mountainous only a few days before He read a lot of seafaring fiction and balked at the traditional hyperbole They're not tsunamis he'd said They did not tower beyond all possibility of quantitive grasp a quarter of a mile or more above the rent base level of the sea Physical reality did not dissolve in a storm His case had been lucidly argued It made perfect sense at the time We had sealed everything and retreated to the main cabin There was no earthly reason to venture outside beyond the perimeter of our semitransparent capsule To do so might perhaps have been survivable After all mariners throughout history had surely done such things I could not even for a moment conceive how Hold on Frazer said They were the most unnecessary words I ever heard from him Copying the others I had used lengths of nylon rope to lash myself to the metal frame of the horseshoe seating Blankets and life-vests served as shock-absorbers As we went into the wall we were seized by forces beyond all human capacity for understanding The scene outside was similarly incomprehensible dominated by fluid masses in motion immense beyond all prospect of articulation A writer of sufficient morbity might have grasped at this unspeakable raging liquid horror as a consummation of nihilism and a spiritual ravishment but it said nothing to me It was mere stupidity scaled up to the proportions of cosmic aberration Nobody spoke Bolton discernibly groaned his exhalation audible even through the crashing din The waves were not mountains I laughed inwardly now at this cheap concession to intellectual sobriety The Pythoness was a fragile speck lost amid crawling hills and valleys of water We could only stare out upon it appalled our minds broken upon the edge of its vast negligence From beyond the shrieking insanity of the wind twisted beyond torture a black mass was breaking in upon us It was the storm in itself the thing A continuous rumbling tuned to the nerve-strings of our guts shook us down through its nested chasms of somber resonance ever deeper down into the very death-rattle of the world reverberating eternally among the bass-bins of Hell Wild hammer blows rained down upon the boat battering us into bruised prostration We each clung to nearby fixtures desperate for relative immobility until our muscles screamed Intermittently the scene was wracked by spasms of electric discharge White slices of horror interrupted the thundering darkness searing nightmare flashes of cosmic incoherence that raped our retinas into tormeted submission I no longer knew whether my eyes were open or shut I no longer knew anything Then we were upside down or worse clinging to what we could as geometry snapped releasing us into profundities without dimension The fabric of space had splintered into a wreckage of impossible angles colliding planes and discontinuous vectors The sensible world had simply collapsed upon itself For some indeterminate period all that came through was the spatial noise of randomly shuffled video accompanied by audio howl It was cut-up multimedia from the interior of a time-stripped Azathothic spin-cycle From inside it seemed unimaginable that there could ever be an end but eventually there was Scruggs was working his way towards me through the swirling ruins of space His limbs were outstretched bracing him awkwardly against the tumbling surfaces Strobed by the lighning flashes it looked as if he had been crucified upon gravitational collapse His expression was grimly determined I prepared myself for some kind of lunatic death-fight in a spinning spatial frame I know it's you he said Another pronoun with no anchor It wasn't necessary to feign weariness or contempt His eyes glittered with madness So how's the storm going Symns It's what you wanted isn't it The others had to have heard catching his words at least in rough outline but they said nothing I was reluctant to let my gaze drift from the maniac closing in upon me even for a fraction of a second but in my peripheral vision I could see them all watching fixedly and silent They probably thought something was about to be settled one way or another It's the way you pretend there's no God But you know don't you You know what a storm is what any storm is and this one in particular He was close now much too close His face pitted like an illtreated asteroid was only inches from my own The Lord judges you Symns Christ Scruggs get a grip We arrive in the release zone and this happens the great test and yet here we still are nestled in the hands of the almighty So what now There was a deafening crash as if the iron gates of the Eschaton had been blasted open 24 My auditory nerves were shot emitting nothing for perhaps a minute except the thin whine of physiological damage As my hearing began to restore itself patchily the ruinous proceedings rushed in There was a brief scream of tortured metal immediately succeeded by a sharp crack Frazer and Bolton exchanged grimly-charged glances They both seemed to understand what had happened What was that I asked Bolton I could still scarcely hear my own raised voice The cage he said It could only have been the cage His face looked ashen in the gloom Our lightning protection was gone The entire superstructure had disappeared into the sea its splash lost among the thunder and typhoon ravings Frazer was already unfastening himself from the horseshoe face aglow with the firm intention of action The storm had crossed its peak but it had scarcely begun to subside The idea of leaving the cabin was abhorrent to me in a way that is hard to adequately describe Clearly such a course was unavoidable Frazer was already pulling the hatch door open It was like the breaking of a dike With the flood of water came a wave of sound dominated by the banshee wail of the wind An unmuffled peal of thunder came close to unfixing my precarious handholds and throwing me back off my feet The boat pitched crazily each lurch now a local tide pouring water in and out of the cabin stirring us into it Things carefully stowed and fastened were torn free We half crawled half swam to and out of the door Outside in the heaving cross-lashed chaos we were greeted by a scene of lurid abnormality The Pythoness was enveloped in a cold green flame A spectral luminosity had wrapped itself around every particle of exposed metal Its variations in intensity were distributed in a cryptic pattern speaking somehow of traffic and circulation In places it had concentrated into patches of blazing incandescence From these zones of green dazzlement it spread like an amoeboid wraith advancing exploratory tendrils into regions of strategic significance The bridge in particular was ablaze with it From the single machine room window that was visible from where I stood a hard alien light burned Whatever it was that had happened it had awakened the snakes They both roamed the vessel furiously animated swathed in the green light tool-heads unfolded into artificial flowers Despite their luminosity it was difficult to track them They moved with the sinuous cunning of serpents The deck was pitching wildly Horizontal sheets of rain cut across us I clung grimly to the rails expecting at any moment to be fried by twenty million volts of electrical ruin released from the grumbling sky The glow pooled thickly upon the deck around my feet spiraling up and around my body down my arms There was no pain Straight above the upper bridge was wrapped in a rotating green halo illuminating the spiny wreckage of support rods where the cage had been ripped away Why were we out here I could only assume that the plan was to repair our lightning defenses It would have been laughable even under very different conditions Gusts of hysterical amusement tagged at the fibers of my brain We'd need coils of heavy copper wire I guessed They had to be found then carried through tilting storm-drenched chaos and up into the aura of doom to be fixed in place and all the time they'd be an open invitation to electrocution There were only two places where they could possibly be The first of the snakes had been shadowing us since we left the cabin It avoided close proximity without drifting far out of range When we split up I lost sight of it before seconds later picking up its signature lateral undulations by the door to the bridge When I tried to slip past it and inside it maneuvered gracefully to obstruct me extended drill-bits shrieking as if enraged Its manipulators clicked like pincers The thought of fighting it never seriously crossed my mind I backed away slowly So it had to be the machine room The second snake had posted itself there as a sentry It had bitten Bolton badly on the side of the face I saw him fall back shocked and defeated almost losing his grip on the handrail There was a lot of blood He was yelling at me but at first his words were lost in the wind They became audible as I approached Who's controlling them he was shouting to no one in particular It was less a question than a cry of mental revolt Nothing was controlling them At least from what we had seen they were as autonomous as any animal we had ever seen A short storm-flogged haul along the rail took me to the machine room The technophidian guard at the hatch twisted aside to let me through and I stepped in The glamor had been concentrated there to an extreme degree It shrouded the containment unit in a turbular harsh luminosity without compromising the heart of darkness I stepped over to it prepared to do what was necessary but nothing was being asked of me Nothing had changed It was pointless to be there Now that I could look around in that cramped space the speculation that it might have held bulky stocks of electro-conductive cable seemed unthinkable It took only the most perfunctory exploration to confirm this negative fact beyond all question Whatever the others had been trying to do their endeavors had led them to the same conclusion as mine Bolton had already withdrawn back into the cabin to bandage his wound The rest of us stood in the thrashing rain for a few moments stupidly dazed This boat is fucked Frazer stated calmly 25 It was eerily calm After what had been threatened our survival seemed uncanny unreal We sat on the horseshoe mostly silent exhausted to the point of perverse ecstasy After hours of habituation to the storm waves the stillness was an inverted lurching There's something under the boat Bolton said Something Scruggs responded He was too tired to sound genuinely interested Something big You've seen it Frazer asked It was clear that he didn't expect an answer in the affirmative Bolton hesitated as if vaguely panicked and mentally paralyzed by an uncertainty he was unable to fix in place He really had no idea what he'd seen I sympathized though coldly and sparingly His lack of mental discipline was breaking him on the rack It wasn't going to be pleasant to watch Did you see this big something Frazer pushed Yes I saw it Of course I saw it The confusing part of this to me Bobby said Frazer softly is that you've been down here in the cabin for over an hour and before that outside in the night So there's no possible way you could have seen anything It was surprising to hear this stated with such brutality It must have been before Bolton tried I forgot it somehow and then it came back It hid for a while It doesn't want to be noticed Listen to yourself Frazer said The demand was useless Bolton was lost in his own confusion beyond reach Yes Bolton insisted completing a circuit within some deeply buried track of interior monologue The look in his eyes didn't belong on this earth or seem to have originated there That's it I'd forgotten It was when we stopped at the island There was no island Frazer was struggling to keep his voice level Shouting was not going to help he no doubt fully realized but Bolton's inability to get a grip on his own florid delusions was already pushing the discussion over an edge and taking him with it One additional cycle of this exchange and it would be an empty verbal brawl Then Frazer would silence Bolton within a small number of minutes The signal would have been cut but remain undead Whatever it was that we were haunted by would have thickened and darkened Wait I said I want to hear this We all should Frazer got up without saying another word and left the cabin It wasn't petulance he just wanted no part of what was going to happen now He was voting with his feet because command wasn't going to work Bolton's shattered gaze followed him out So this island I prompted to pull him back Whatever couldn't be scraped out of him fast would be lost forever For a moment he simply looked dazed drowning in the swirl Was it already gone I was less than a second from slapping him hard across the uninjured side of his face to break the spell when something engaged and a spark re-ignited in his eyes He was looking at me and no longer into some private reconstruction of the all-consuming horizon Yes the floating island Some ship-wrecked part of him recognized that it was disintegrating on a reef beyond rescue There was only a little time remaining to salvage what we could Tell me about it You don't remember he begged It doesn't matter I said It's your version that we want right now My version He was straying already We were at the floating island This was closer to a straight-up lie than I had hoped would be necessary Oh yes Things were reconnecting somewhere behind the shimmer of glazed vision It was incredible wasn't it The scale of it A huge mass of jungled mountain drifting into us from out of the mist It was like He was stumped It hadn't been like anything And then Did we all go ashore The directionless splashing was back At some level he knew the story was separating him from everything No it was just you Bob It was another step into cynical deceit but I could see no alternative If it was to come out he had to be cast into his own story That was already settled He'd taken the steps that mattered some hours ago and probably much more distantly before How long was I there for he asked me I shrugged There was no point at all in my telling him this tale or even helping him to click it together I didn't know where to begin and more importantly any more of this would have made it surreptitiously mine Quite a while I said eventually with enormous reluctance retreating tactically into the indefinite The nudge seemed to be enough because he leant forward slightly focusing There was a lot of climbing he said The paths were like stairs It was tiring but it wasn't mountaineering I had to remind myself this isn't a temple No one cut these steps or built these walls He paused dramatically Was that true though There were no blocks of course no architectural pieces It had been made as a single thing coherently And it was old My geology isn't that great but the structure had to have been completed eighty to ninety million years ago late in the Cretaceous by the look of it Soft discolored chalk stacked up in undistorted strata the horizontal layers scarcely disturbed where they were visible beneath the growth Lichens moss creepers covered almost everything It was damp No bugs that I could see though which was strange so no flowers Then I noticed There were signs on the walls Signs Glyphs of some kind artificial patterns incredibly detailed and obviously ordered by a communicative intelligence They were densely packed with information cryptically irregular and fractalized based on a scalar organization of what had to be systems of meaningful parts within parts nested recursively conforming to a mathematical scheme Naturally I couldn't understand them at all at first He paused concerned perhaps that his flight of recollection was accelerating into desolate outer tracts beyond the perimeter of our patience Of all the things he might realistically have worried about that was not among them Go on I urged There was a code evidently so it couldn't have been what it seemed The puzzle announced itself openly but it was deeply difficult It was like nothing I had ever encountered before You know this might sound crazy but it still seems as if most of the thinking I've ever done in my life took place up there running sub-routines I hadn't suspected human brains could hold together There was time somehow for an entire research project orchestrated phased colossally sub-divided within itself He looked up or out his voice lightening How do you decrypt signals from an alien intelligence Aliens Not extraterrestrials that's a conception including far too much positive information It's already a theory an image and it's not even relevant Alien meaning only something you know nothing about Something utterly not us An unknown cognitive process He paused perhaps worried that he was losing me which he was Zero-empathy communication that's the problem You know SETI-type questions Isn't SETI precisely about aliens The old kind Beings from other worlds Sure yes In that regard the analogy wasn't helpful Thing is I'm not sure what could be A script from the absolute unknown how do you even begin to think about that You have an answer What's the question really That has to come first With an effort he paused again slowed ratcheting down the pace to increase the chance of something getting through Meaning is a diversion It evokes too much empathy Shared ground You have to ask instead what is a message In the abstract What's the content at the deepest most reliable level when you strip away all the presuppositions that you can The basics are this You've been reached by a transmission That's the irreducible thing Something has been received Then comes the next step If it's reached us it has to have borrowed some part of our brains Lend me your ears Yes exactly that Except you have to go abstract You have to find the abstract ear the third ear That's the key to all of this really I think to all of it The message has to latch on If it's alien very foreign and it isn't tightly targeted then it has to be extremely abstract There's no other way it could be adapted to an intelligent receptor in general You can see where I'm going with this I couldn't not remotely but I nodded anyway How could it teach me about abstraction It's a paradox because that's the very thing the lesson presupposes To get in it had to be there already inside waiting This is getting way too There was no way around the word abstract for me Bobby That wasn't actually the most serious problem though perhaps at another level it was With every word Bolton spoke I sensed a patient clicking at inner doors like the methodical testing of a combination lock Bolton hadn't heard me at all He was in free flow carried forward by the sheer compulsion of the sequence There's a circuit circuitry it was there in the pattern once I realized that's what I had to be looking for and before of course Sure it was information deposited in layers but it had to be interlock machinery It was docking The lichen crumbled away easily beneath my fingers down into the labyrinth the crypt Then I understood And And I was afraid You're not making any sense Bobby Scruggs interjected Like me but still more urgently he was pleading for more but of another kind altogether Bolton looked up at Scruggs as if seeing him for the first time Have you ever thought much about carnivorous plants he asked We're on a boat Bobby Scruggs said in a futile appeal for basic consensus We're on a fucking boat I know that Bolton agreed But it's complicated His eyes were bright now engaged The lights were on inside even if they were somehow green It wasn't that I thought he'd been devoured from within by an intelligent vegetable entity from an unencountered island at all or even for a moment Nevertheless there was the vivid impression of a visitor something planted among us Don't you see Bolton continued patiently The process of trying to work it out what I had thought was the way eventually to grasp it to unlock the secret it wasn't like that That was all wrong It was unlocking me So there's no way to understand it It was what I assumed no what I wanted him to be saying steered mostly by instinct in the direction of psychological protection Any other interpretation would have been intolerably intimate Behind the discussion were burrowing things and I didn't want them getting in That would just help it spread Would that be so bad I probed guessing the answer hoping that even now he might still be able to guide the looming conclusion in a different direction I don't know why He'd forgotten a piece of the puzzle perhaps deliberately Even in that blank shard of amnesia was a glimpse of something far better left unglimpsed Scruggs too shuddered slightly Then there was screaming Bolton remembered It was me though wasn't it I was screaming No Bobby you weren't screaming Scruggs said It sounded as if he was trying to convince himself There were no screams It was quiet No one heard anything No no of course it was quiet It was as if he was scolding himself for his own stupidity I'd climbed up a long way by then The boat looked tiny down below You know as they always say like a toy A small toy You guys were all up on deck in a group mere specks really I could only just tell who was who by remembering what you'd been wearing That's when I saw it floating deep down behind and beneath the boat It was immense Not like a whale it was on a different scale altogether I thought I remember thinking could it be the shadow of the island cast down into the sea But the shape wasn't right for that There was too much shape and it was designed for swimming obviously It was a sea creature There was no mistaking it It had bilateral symmetry a body plan a neck flippers a tail The overall size end-to-end I guess was about three city blocks Given Bolton's intelligence and education he had to know how this sounded So maybe half a mile long I kind of think possibly a little longer he murmured almost inaudibly So nothing actually imaginable I noted I had to It would have been unbearably condescending to leave the claim unchecked Imaginable he repeated after me turning the pre-negated body of the word over slowly exploring its convolutions of sense It should have been unimaginable It was as if he was recalling some ancient principle of reality abandoned ninety million years ago I'm not insane he said then snapping back into defined coexistence with us His words were carefully enunciated now soft slow and calm For the first time it seemed as if talking the phenomenon through might be helping if only at the most trivial psychological level I understand of course no animal on this planet has ever been close to that size so it has to be something else a communication A message I'm thinking some kind of projection Of what Scruggs stood up and left now silently with an apologetic glance at Bolton He couldn't take anymore Why should this have been the threshold moment Was it no more than an arbitrary point on a continuum of alienation Or was there something about the idea of a communicative projection that Scruggs found intolerable If the latter was the case and I could understand it even part of it I knew then that some essential clarity would have been reached about us if not it but there was no time Did you ever read anything about ontology Bolton asked me I was familiar with the word just a little but enough to recognize it as a tangential response to my question Whatology Ontology he repeated missing the deflective intent of my query It's the science of being An investigation into the thingness of things or perhaps not that not exactly That's a science really I asked piling in as much conspicuous skepticism as I could Experimental research into pure thingness It wasn't something I'd delved into far or made any effort to keep up with and it sounded demanding in a way I didn't think we needed In fact it struck me as a reckless way to open doors we should be trying to close and then to triple lock Even without such concerns twistedly going meta about our predicament seemed likely to further stress capabilities that were already stretched to the outer limits of their tolerance Nonlinearity led to explosive complexity fast The last thing we could deal with now mentally-shattered as we were was the recursive amplification of difficulty If Bolton picked up on my doubts which was unlikely he was nevertheless determined to bypass them It's just he pushed on I've been thinking about it About what I was in no mood to help him out even if I could have done About what he mumbled back Perhaps that's it It meant nothing to me This is about the thing under the boat You're saying being is some kind of Kraken was the obvious rider but I restrained myself from attaching it He had to see the problem already almost certainly with greater clarity than I did He looked startled as if he'd given away more than intended It was a reaction that was impossible to understand More than anything he'd yet said it was a sign that he'd lost his grip on the conversation entirely becoming untethered from the most rudimentary content of his own elaborate discourse The thing under the boat I reminded him again The circus animal We have sonar he asked no one in particular If there's anything there it will show up The jolt of disconnection might have been annoying but it wasn't Arcane philosophical speculation was taking us nowhere or at least nowhere good so this new avenue had to be worth pursuing Stark negative evidence might catalyze something I thought as we left for the bridge The thought of motivated technical tinkering at this point was strangely comforting Bolton arrived at our destination first It's been removed he said as I entered The entire module has gone No one here would have known how to do that except you It had not been meant to sound like an accusation but of course it did He looked hurt as if now at last receiving the slap I had planned for him earlier Could it have been pulled out remotely I asked in an attempt to walk-back the thoughtless charge By the snakes They were doing something here last night Frazer announced his presence with a communicative cough There's no sign of the sonar mod Bolton explained turning towards him Was it ever installed Once asked the sanity of the question was immediately striking Bolton slapped his forehead theatrically How could we know I asked We couldn't Not with the internal databases fried Why are you wasting your time with this Even if we had sonar the electronics would have been burnt-out by the lightning strike like everything else Scruggs had drifted back too He hung on the bridge door smiling aggressively Clowns he said Bolton and I looked at each other There was nothing to contest I don't understand how it could come to this said Frazer struggling to keep the tone of disapproval in check There's no such state as understanding Bolton said Not really Von Neuman put it best In mathematics you don't understand things You just get used to them You understand at the point you're permitted to stop thinking Those were the last words I ever heard him say 26 Bolton disappeared We had no way of knowing exactly when He'd spoken inconsequentially to Scruggs roughly five hours before his absence was noted Concern was slow to escalate Scruggs and Zodh were bonded in asymmetrically-animated conversation It had the appearance of an interrogation That was becoming the default communication format on The Pythoness Frazer was listening attentively at a distance I was further out still picking up what I could Bolton was not in the scene at all but the discussion was about him What do you mean gone Scruggs was asking Gone away There is no away We're on a boat See like this Zodh was drawing something in the empty space between them with his fingers Scruggs adamantly refused to pay attention What are you saying he demanded as if the digit-whorls were not it In simple words Simple In a way simple In another way not You see More finger work in a complex repeating pattern It's down True down What does that have to do with Bobby Zodh suspended the ineffective demonstration Like everything else on The Pythoness it was going nowhere We conducted a preliminary search Then another It wasn't easy to know what we were looking for A final note of some kind or an unintentional message Signs of unaccountable damage Traces of blood There was nothing At least nothing that we could find He was simply gone Did any of you notice anything before I asked Unusual words or behavior Who are you Sherlock fucking Holmes Scruggs bristled His expression could not have been more venomous if he had personally witnessed me throttling Bolton and dumping his body over the side What's your problem I snarled back Reluctant to escalate and unwilling to retreat he stood his ground and glared silently I ran some emergency calculations If it became necessary to beat Scruggs unconscious it would complicate things Back off I said He did a little but enough On the third search cycle Frazer found something There was a hand-print on the containment unit It appeared suspended perhaps a half inch from the surface The detail was exquisite To describe it as something like a delicate grease mark on a glass screen might suggest smudging misleadingly but in every other respect that was the impression It's Bobby's Scruggs queried for all of us There was no point asking whether we had a reference copy of his fingerprints Qasm information security procedures meant we had nothing Is there anything on this boat only Bolton could have touched I asked Something in his locker Scruggs suggested We looked for something that could serve as fingerprint dust settling eventually on a packet of antiseptic powder from the medical supplied Frazer extracted a plastic protractor from Bolton's locker There was a surreptitious quality to his procedure and an odd expression accompanying it At the time it was easy to overlook The prints clearly matched We had all known they would What do you think he was trying to do Scruggs asked Does it matter I wondered aloud How could it not Frazer snapped back Another pointless argument invited us in No one was tempted by it It annihilated him Scruggs asked Or something I muttered It was as if I could hear the sharp pop the sound of a tennis ball twisted through a hidden dimension Still it might not have been like that It might not have been like anything much A stupid accident suicide the sea This thing's directly killing us now Frazer said His voice was a soft snarl Whatever fear there might have been swimming through his words was swept away by the disgust We don't know that I said The phrase was getting tedious even to me I needed to have it printed on a T-shirt Question your conclusions No one wanted to hear it Starved of even fragile hypotheticals there was no enthusiasm for any deeper submergence into unbelief We need to call this in Frazer said Then we're going to need a mobile device You have anything at all like that A phone A smart watch What do you think I am a Chinese teenager So nothing Of course nothing The contract specified nothing He took a bitter delight in this detail How about Scruggs Does he seem like the smart watch type to you Frazer said cutting across him So it's just between us I concluded The remark was intended to be upsetting 27 Scruggs tumbled down into the cabin scarcely keeping his physical balance His mental balance had not been sustained so well We're going to be okay he said We're saved His features were animated by a kind of rapture I met it It being I asked before Frazer could An angel Scruggs replied His confidence without declining by the slightest degree in inner luminosity stumbled before our incomprehension Or something I'm betting on something Frazer grunted before pulling himself back wearily from mere dismissal Did it speak It told me everything And the main point of this everything was It's hard to remember exactly Scruggs admitted his voice twisted in frustration The message was huge you know beyond libraries like whole cities of meaning planet minds The voice was like a song That's useful said Frazer drily Maybe you could hum it for us I'm being serious Scruggs protested as if the opposite possibility were in any way the problem I've never been more serious Not ever This he made some wild world-encompassing gesture with his right hand is nothing in comparison Nothing at all It's trash and lies Seen through the eyes of an angel it's lost being Confusion Roughly what did it say I asked him He glared at me his features suddenly petrified If it had only been the two of us his response would have been to close like a cliff-face but everyone was listening This was his one chance and he knew it The Lord fathoms the abyss for our sakes Christ Frazer rolled his eyes upwards Don't mock this Scruggs said Don't mock what you don't understand If you refuse his helping hand you're not getting out He wants to rescue us There's new information I asked Protocol would be to debrief Scruggs methodically and privately There was no opportunity for anything like that under current conditions There was no escape from the circus If it went fast it was just possible that Frazer's abrasiveness wouldn't grind it away Scruggs needed no prompting Death he said That's what Bobby saw beneath the boat His death The angels told you that Frazer sneered He'd had enough Madness had swallowed the boat and right now Scruggs incarnated the fact He was an opportunistic target too exposed to neglect Isn't it obvious Scruggs persisted ignoring the jab Look at it Bobby's death had flippers It isn't literal No it isn't Not remotely What it is is bullshit Scruggs took a step backwards as if physically jolted by the savagery of Frazer's derision There was a woundedness to his stance expression and voice now Despite that he still wasn't prepared to stop You have to see it he pleaded See what I asked I wanted to know Scruggs stared at me his features twisted by a mixture of gratitude and loathing Go on I urged him It could be important Of course it's important he almost yelled It's the only important thing It's written It Everything The library isn't in this world This world is in the library and the library is in The Book We were told and refused to believe Now it's too late You have to see that he repeated Frazer had been restraining himself his face rigid with infuriation Now the psychological bulkhead burst How does this shit help us he snarled At all He was staring at me rather than at Scruggs It made sense from his perspective Without my intervention he wouldn't have been hearing any of this He wanted his crew back That was his problem though not mine He didn't need his crew That was the point he was insistently missing They were all useless to him and had been since the moment we set out We hadn't even needed the snakes but if any action were required they could manage it perfectly well Scruggs theocosmic visions were as relevant to the success of our mission as anything he might say or do Why not let him continue I suggested We don't know where significant information is going to come from It's not as if we're pressed for time Frazer's fury was still cresting but he had nothing to say Scruggs hated doing this I could tell He was not far from the brink of tears and he was not the weepy type His head was tilted slightly downwards and averted as he squirmed upon the hook of social judgment Still despite all of that he was driven to speak Everything we could need to know is in The Book he said That's the point It's all there We only have to search for it in the right place What do we need to know I asked him At first it seemed as if the question had caught him by surprise This is The Fall he said eventually The descent never ended So it's all there in The Good Book Frazer glossed letting his sarcasm off the leash That's excellent to know because for a while back there I was beginning to think we might actually be facing a difficult problem It's not about the message not really Scruggs said I had never seen anyone so visibly wracked by frustration It's about about Topology I suggested Bolton wasn't there so it had to be me He grimaced at the word Insides I interpreted True insides And the other thing There had been a time as a child when I had read about a girl turning tennis balls inside-out without touching them as if that made any difference They had inverted impossibly with a popping sound the story had said It had been non-fiction supposedly a manifestation of real supernature The impression it had left upon me had been deep and persistent The event itself the tennis ball business had probably never happened but that didn't matter after a while The topological limits of reality mattered There was a vivid cognitive reference point now A series of words had been complicated in being vividly illustrated Topology naturally but also dimensionality boundary reality The walls were not where they appeared to be Yes insides Scruggs said seizing upon the word like a drowning man at a rope It's about what's inside what false prisons You're right about that Symns And then Thank you It was a penance for him to say that so excessive that it disturbed me Would he have thanked a flagrant minion of Satan for a vocabulary item A thick sediment of suspicion still coated his gaze as he looked into my eyes his face radiant with liberated insight His fight with me had been shelved with a definitiveness that I found hard to absorb The mind is in the brain but the brain is in the soul he said reenergized once again rapt That's not it though is it I nudged That's not really what it was about Frazer trampled my response He wasn't going to leave me alone with this as he had with Bolton Bolton was missing strongly presumed dead You think that means anything he demanded Which part Any of it Fucking metaphysics in general Self-denial of the soul Scruggs commented as if airing a detached analysis defiantly and coldly abusive It's a fascinating thing to see You aren't seeing anything I wondered if they were going to physically attack each other but instead it ended there nowhere At least the first phase did There was a second installment still to come 28 Zodh had kept himself out of it He'd been working The deck of the Pythoness was coated in a synthetic material with a vaguely rubbery texture It had been designed to provide optimum grip for our feet approaching gentle adhesion Particularly when trodden upon with bare feet produced a sensation of ghostly stickiness that had been initially disconcerting It also contributed to temperature control adjusting albedo in response to the intensity of light Now with the sun heavily filtered by the clouds the color had deepened to a rich green Zodh had found a large can of black paint among the stores along with a surprisingly delicate brush With this equipment he had covered something like a third of the deck in a massive swirl-thickened diagram intricately annotated with words numbers and figures Vortical cores of spiral intensity span out into meandering interconnected threads The basic pattern easily extracted from the dense web of detail was instantly recognizable The green phosphorescence had been drawing the same thing during the night of the storm Before that it had been hidden in the guidelines for a card game The oracle Zodh had tried and failed to teach Bolton and Scruggs a week before was now a static image baked in the Pacific stove What are you doing Scruggs asked drawn into the labyrinth He peered at the illustration where the coiling threads of abstraction converged upon a representational image It was a human figure minimalized to a few crude lines falling Is that Bobby he asked Zodh nodded Crossing he noted gravely Then lightening suddenly Look Lent it to him He was pointing to the only part of the figure captured with even nominal representational fidelity a T-shirt bearing the legible logo 89 Gone now Goddamn you to Hell Scruggs exploded What the fuck Zodh smiled Us he whispered at the edge of audibility Goddamn us all way down He pointed at another figure more peripheral its head wreathed in some mad halo that might have been black fire or thorns All the way down he repeated Into the bottomless pit The reference to scripture struck Scruggs dumb He was no longer convening with Zodh now but with something else something that had seized upon Zodh and was using him as a channel Scruggs deflected his gaze heavenwards subtly but unmistakably as if searching for some spectral indications that had not arisen from the abyss He found none apparently because his expression hardened Zodh had not finished he had scarcely begun When your savior reached out to you across the gulf he looked just for moment like Shut the fuck up Scruggs snapped You know nothing about this I had no doubt then that the exact opposite was true Don't lie I said stripping as much hostility from the words as I could He stared at me coldly and silently ashamed Whatever Zodh had been saying it was the message he didn't want to let out but it had escaped now Within seconds minutes at the most we would know Why do you care he mumbled eventually About Jesus Or the other guy It isn't what you think What do I think The serpent is the redeemer Zodh interrupted in perfect English He had to have been quoting something It was enough He who descended into the ultimate depths fathoming damnation to its end in order to salvage us Our Lord of the Phosphorescent Abyss The passion and the harrowing of Hell had become indistinguishable on the way to something worse Christ I muttered as comprehension dawned the words aimed less at Scruggs than into his vicinity He's calling you a Satanist The remark was designed as a diversion I'd seen another thing else further out at the edge of the painting and wasn't keen for either Scruggs or Frazer to notice it Two figures without obvious marks of identification stood close together apparently locked in some kind of confrontation One of them seemed to have a gun You know the gatekeeper to the bottomless pit You have story of Zom in your country Zodh asked That's what Some Guam heathen shit Scruggs asked in return The insult was meant to block enquiry He wasn't interested He had all the stories he needed far more now Not from Guam Zodh replied earnestly Came to Guam on a boat Long time ago There's a story I asked feeding Yes Zodh beamed crookedly An ancient wiliness pranced behind his eyes Old story Maybe the oldest in the world Letting the ludicrous exaggeration pass uncontested I waited for more I'd counted on my interest driving Scruggs away and it worked He drifted off and disappeared into the cabin Odz was lost in her own spell Kao raged for the final war So Zom turned her back on the world which meant that the last days had come It wasn't exactly once upon a time but the rhythm was somehow similar The fishermen who had long tormented her sleep were gathered in their boats above with their nets and spears She reached up to catch them and drag them down The scene was terrible Look there are eight monsters attacking us the men cried as they drowned No there is just one said the village witch who was watching from the beach That which seems multiple connects beneath the surface Her voice was not loud and few heard it I thought he'd finished but he hadn't quite Above there were many screams Below a single murmur There aren't so many things in the world he said There are only several 29 Scruggs was dead too but we had a body this time crucified upon the cabin wall by the galley My limited understanding of Christian orthodoxy told me all the holy wounds were accounted for Railing bolts served as nails data-cable staples as thorns The steak skewer that had punctured his left side lay on the floor nearby in a little pool of gore We had all noticed the scene within a few seconds of each other after entering the cabin together There wasn't anything obvious to say Frazer checked that he was dead It was a necessary formality When he had finished he didn't waste our time with a confirmation of what we all knew No one could be bothered to say fuck It was assumed Christ Frazer said before he could stop himself Then because the wall of profanity had already been breached What a fucking mess No one had been alone with Scruggs during the few hours since we had last seen him alive That was impossible naturally but also beyond all question Since there were no points of purchase for the requisite cycle of suspicion and accusation we merely stared at each other dumbly hunting through each others faces without knowing what for Almost done now said Zodh calmly an odd glitter in his eyes You did this Frazer asked levelly He had to even though it made no sense Zodh nodded It was a gesture from some cosmos of alien causality in which physics found no place Zodh didn't kill Scruggs I said The pedestrian truth had to be stated At least not in any way that would be taken seriously even for a moment in an American court of law We spoke across Zodh as if he wasn't there He had removed himself from the sphere of reason and from all the conventions of elementary social consideration that belonged to it So what did he just confess to now Some voodoo shit would be my guess Meaning what If I knew that I'd already be in a lunatic asylum Rather than here he said He came impressively close to keeping the bitterness out of his voice None of us were in the cabin with Scruggs when he died Fuck Frazer spat He wasn't arguing We should bury him at sea It was 333pm which was an ominous time for me The Moron's Law intrusion had been time-stamped with it 30 When I stepped out onto the deck Frazer was waiting for me He had a handgun It's Bolton's he explained pre-empting my question It had been designed for infiltration through high-performance security screens When dismantled into parts it could be concealed within an ordinary tool box unrecognizably An exotic explosive in the shells suppressed the chemical signature Why would he do that I mused aloud I'd ask to look at it but you know how pointless that would be We were approaching the fate threshold or already passing through it Then one of us would have to die Don't do this I'm running out of crew he said ignoring my request So it has to be now You're going to kill me It didn't seem likely not just yet but I had to ask No he began before correcting course Not unless you make that unavoidable I want information Frazer was too stable to be frightening In fact having crossed this line he seemed calmer still Even with a gun pointed at my abdomen it wasn't difficult to hold my tone of voice level What is it that you think I know The question hadn't been intended as a paradox but once said it sounded like one That would have annoyed me if I had been on the other side of the interrogation Frazer scarcely seemed to notice You have to know something he insisted If I did do you imagine I'd have let things come to this You're misunderstanding me he explained almost with a laugh I'm not accusing you of conspiracy Then what When we reached the forty percent casualty threshold your attitude became unacceptable So now you're going to share everything you know about QASM without reservation There's no reason you could have not to do that at least no reason that wouldn't be a solid justification for killing you It didn't seem like a point worth trying to joke about The end of all professional discretion then Exactly The gun edged me on further Okay sure you're right I was ready to walk the verbal plank but his introductory remarks weren't over yet Scruggs very much wanted us to have this conversation He didn't know that I had this he said waving the gun so he had another suggestion He passed me a crudely-machined blade then stepped back keeping a safe distance I turned it over Nasty I placed it down on the floor beside me He's not wasn't so bad Thing is he was scared Of me Of what he thought you are Which is Can't you guess Qasm's agent You can do better than that I couldn't Frazer looked disappointed He thought you were it The drifting pronoun again It The cargo You mean like but the analogy escaped me an avatar a mask a skin a meat-puppet there's no obvious name for such a thing I pretended to consider that for a while It's bullshit I know he conceded unnecessarily without awaiting my response Warped fascination aside you're no more at one with the cargo than the rest of us And how much is that Yes that's a question isn't it There was a flicker of uncaged inquisitiveness bringing us to the brink of an awkward alliance Then he stopped himself before spiraling down into it That way there was no end But first down to business The company He nodded I don't have anything against you Symns or at least not much not seriously but what I have to say now could sound hostile If you don't tell me something usable here within the next thirty minutes I'm going to have to put a bullet into your guts You're good I acknowledged He'd made the only move that could work So what's it going to be I'll share what little I've got and hope it's enough Unsure whether my compliance had been sufficiently emphatic I added Definitely It was easy to say but trying to pull my limited understanding of QASM together into something communicable took effort There'd been eight years of episodic interaction when bundled together didn't amount to very much It had been almost entirely restricted to investigative work on the activities of ex-employees along with secure deliveries of small objects and documents that I never exactly saw Recently and reluctantly I'd become their go-to guy for messy stuff they wanted to keep at a distance but the amount of additional insight coming along with that had been deliberately held down to a minimum on both sides That was the deal If I'd had to start guessing about the nature of the company's core business the hypothesis would have tended towards specialized surveillance and signal-processing systems with an orientation to submarine research The geek-paranoia flavor of the corporate culture as I had encountered it repeatedly but only ever tangentially suggested scientific equipment whose economic viability was based upon spin-off military applications allowing the company to tap into currents of black-budget funding Whatever it was they did was packaged into confidential project modules sealed with code names and strategically obscured by disinformation If I'd wanted to conduct industrial espionage against them it would have been hard I didn't remotely I was told what Qasm abbreviates once I said stalling as I struggled to gather my thoughts Oh yeah he responded with indifference-sheathed suspicion And you've waited to play that card until now It's only just come back One more lie that stupid and I interrupted before he could complete the threat Quasi- Autonomous Submerged Machines Which helps how Qasm has to be lodged quite deeply in the techno-military complex I ventured with relative confidence Nothing else makes sense Whatever it is that they make it's highly-advanced extremely-robust but I don't think it's a weapon At least it didn't begin as a weapon You've never seen this product No You never wanted to I wanted to do my job Fuck you he said anger two-thirds swamped by dismay You know what's killed us Pride your fanatical pride in professional ignorance You made the suppression of natural curiosity into your occupational specialty your holy fucking calling and now here we are Here we are I agreed He came close to pulling the trigger then out of sheer exhaustion and disgust or so it seemed Everybody was looking for simplification at that point so I didn't really care You heard of Ben McClean I asked him It sounds as if there have to be a lot of them The neuroelectronics guy Doubt it The brain is the interface That was him It was huge If you say so I'm not tuned into that nerd shit Point is he came out of Qasm And he was gluing brains to computers Bingo He smiled despite himself You expect a bingo point for that You missed Bolton's musings A collision with some kind of brain-interlock technology seemed to be a big part of them Wireless I shrugged I had no idea how this shit worked You better have more than this Symns Frazer said This is zilch-level garbage It's what Qasm is trying to ditch isn't it They built something that breaks into brains and it scared them so much they want us to dispose of it We're disposing of it Really In an ocean trench We're installing it in its natural environment It looks to me as if we're deploying it He was slotting more pieces together than I was What does Qasm do he'd asked me almost a week ago now It did this There are several things I'm not understanding at all but here's one I said half expecting him to menace me back onto the main interrogation track but he let me proceed Why wouldn't you distrust what is happening here totally Isn't this little struggle session exactly the sort of circus that would open the flood-gates of hallucinatory delirium He tensed ready to ratchet up the violence by a notch but the excuse wasn't there You're asking why I should trust you He knew that wasn't it It's not about me Then what Think about what you're asking me to do here I thought it wasn't about you It isn't I've told you what it's about the circus That word is some kind of technical term now I guess Think about it I asked again It was a dubious request I fully realized Frazer had already isolated thinking about it as the inner mechanism of the syndrome the clicking of a combination lock grinding through permutations on its way to open access privileges Conceive the problem that way though and it was far too late to stop If our own intelligence resources had been turned into an enemy we were already dead Frazer understood that Our conversation demonstrated it What did Bolton do and then Scruggs You're talking about their solo performances He saw it now evidently Do you doubt for a second that they believed what they were saying No Did you believe any of it No again And now you're asking me to talk To lie To spin an insane tale in complete sincerity That's the circus Isn't it Oh seriously fuck you Symns I should probably just shoot you now I found it hard to disagree so I said nothing He was stuck The dream that drifted across us then or what if it were to break in would pass for a dream wasn't from anywhere specific in time or space It came from an absolute elsewhere Whether remembered by a distant predecessor half-a-million years before or anticipated by a machine descendent yet to arrive it was something not now It had been at home among hydrothermal vents in a dense unilluminated medium What it brought up had been sunken in ultimate depths but depth can be hard to see The sun was a distant mass without image Light beams passing through the fluid mass had been stripped down to ghost streaks then lost among cold shadows Only skeletalized vectors remained cosmic rays neutrinos slanting downwards on their path to abstraction It was either the realm of the great worms or that of their inexistence It made little difference down at these ontological depths Reality receded ever further into itself until crossing out into the ever-thickening darkness Their dreams are not our dreams The word nightmare reminds us of such submerged truths My eyes had no doubt wandered as they sought automatically to track this entity without substance or position ungraspable even as a cryptic event It was utterly indescribable by essence until recognized as a time deformation Only then as the question when is this happening twisted into itself and doubled back repeatedly was it possible to stop mentally chasing it down an imaginary line of jinks and feint It had come to this A disturbance in the order of succession The torsion was real and unframed It wasn't anywhere any longer which was the escaped core of the occurrence It was a door but only for as long as whatever stepped through it had already abandoned everything it might at any time have thought itself to be An abstract function crossed the threshold It pulled on a mask I laughed This had to be the material for my performance What Frazer demanded Nothing You're zoned out somewhere Dream-like delusions I admitted shaking the rotten strands of a dead time-line from my head There's been a lot of it about You really want to know 31 It had to be 333pm and it was A figure was waiting for me in the cabin It was Philcarius You've still no idea who I am have you he said Like I care I replied to minimize his leverage Some dead asshole Not even that He shrugged Okay be stupid It's probably too late for anything else in any case That seemed like a good place to end it I turned away expecting him to wink out of phenomenality When I glanced back to check he was still there You have something to say I asked aggressively His smile was no less annoying that I had remembered Whatever sits at the top of your command chain replaced me unexpectedly he said Qasm was taken over That surprises you How We the company caught something An infection Perhaps We'd been fishing for it but it turned out to be too big to land It swallowed us Swallowed It sounded like hyperbole It was done very quickly and smoothly The keys were changed They're sucking all the goodness out before it collapses into a dead husk Goodness That stretched credibility Food He smiled Frazer understands basically You're working for it As if that followed This is bullshit It wasn't that I didn't believe him but it was much too late to matter Most probably the figment was designed to spare Frazer for some reason I could not compute Why be its butcher's knife Philcarius asked Working through its problems list cleaning up after it why would you do that Money Money's the excuse the permission He had a neat hole in the dead center of his forehead the one I'd put there less than two months before I stepped up to him and carefully inserted my index finger into it The fit was perfect It seemed empty inside which made sense because his brains had exited violently through a massive exit wound in the back of his head Such stuff as dreams are made on Visceral too I noted You expected an audio-visual hologram Had I I guess Tactile is cheap Once you're doing high-resolution visual it can be thrown in roughly for free You close to being done I had things to get on with Why not let me tell you how it went down Consider it a contribution to the circus It won't take long Okay I shrugged I still had time We were working on a challenging neuroelectronics project It was going to provide the remote-control system for a submersible Six months in and it was coming together roughly on schedule We were all tired We'd been pushing out to the limits a little further maybe Pulling forty-eight even seventy-two hour sessions as the deadline approached And you fell asleep in the trodes You ever do that micro-nap thing he asked instead of answering Close your eyes and you're gone just for a second even while working Yes that And That's all it took to switch the control-flow around One second out at most and everything had been turned Self-propagating data backwash they said They The crunchies The cable guys It was a conduction problem as far as they were concerned Hey Alex look at the channel indices Isn't that a hyper-linear dependency inversion They were excited about it We knew it had to be possible in principle but no one's seen it before Main thing from my point of view was that I was locked out Locked out of the submersible command loop or locked out of corporate control You're not listening Then what Locked out of sleep Why I was losing the thread The sensible hypothesis doesn't require any why unless a purely mechanical one The door was broken on the way in The sentence of interminable sleeplessness was nothing but a side effect And the less sensible hypothesis It takes sleep and hides it to use as a burrow I thought of the probe He'd been reading it backwards and as he did so the signal amplified We're done here I said It knew what came next After all it was probably nothing but a broken fragment of memory gone feral Don't do this it mimicked like a recording Perhaps it thought I'd persuade myself 32 In the other story now compartmentalized somewhere else Frazer would soon be discovering Bolton's gun at the bottom of his personal storage locker under a loose pile of soiled clothes In this version I retrieved it and checked it over quickly All the pieces a functioning weapon would need were there It made mechanical sense but there was no way of knowing for sure if it would work That wasn't a mission-critical consideration When Frazer came in to look for the weapon precisely on time I was waiting for him He didn't ask me how I had known or anything else He stopped dead already resigned So it is you he said Not really It was complicated but our understanding wasn't important in any case You think there's a sea-beast beneath the boat I asked him No Angels communicating with us No What then Fuck you It could have been said far more ferociously It mostly sounded tired Really That's it Not even the ghost of a story This is your moment Jim And then I'm eliminated That seems to be the pattern So what am I now A physical threat to you personally or a corporate security hole Speaking hypothetically neither would look good would it Despite what is often thought it isn't uncommon to be ready to die Frazer was nearly there but not quite Heavy tentacles of exhaustion were tugging him down into the abyss of absolute sleep but for a few more moments at least he was still fighting for buoyancy playing for time What is it that you want he asked Really You know what I want A confession of my madness If that's how you want to disown it I learnt that Qasm had inserted a chip into my head and I've been talking to it The secrets it revealed will rock your world Something like that You want this to end with a stupid joke It ended weeks ago You did what you could I said There was no chance Fuck you he repeated even more wearily than before but with a hint of sardonic humor breaking in He raked a hand unselfconsciously through his hair as if privately exasperated In an alternative universe he would have made a firm friend I'd never killed anyone I liked before You think I need a final therapeutic moment Seriously fuck you Symns I'm not seeing anyway you get out of this alive Jim but you get that right I'll tell you something weird he said For free When I came into the cabin just now I was looking for a gun That gun actually You'd have been staring into the wrong end of it if I'd been only slightly more decisive It was going to be used as an interrogation device Would I have killed you at the end He didn't know and didn't pretend to Or perhaps he was refusing to lay claim to an innocence that he in fact possessed though it was most likely hidden from him At gunpoint it might seem like an appeal and something intolerably abject I don't think you'd have killed me You're not that kind of guy Thanks So pay me You still angling for a story The story You mean more circus It sounded initially like resistance but it wasn't any longer It's what we're here for undeniably I can't believe you seriously doubt that Let it happen and we could still learn something Alright he said What if I told you we were on the inside of a hollow sphere a ball Like a tennis ball Sure whatever The thing is it only appears as if we're outside it uncontained So a bounded universe Or hidden prison Hidden from the inside It was a bad thought even as a rough broken stump I didn't like being in there with it so I went out onto the deck to watch the stars It was a clear night There were zillions like a science TV show For a moment just before I'd expected to experience it as somehow constrictive the way we're told the ancients did enclosed by a crystal sphere or similar huge container There was nothing like that No laughable delusion Instead there was the simple sensible fact except now intuitively stark that these huge vistas were being produced in the brain I was seeing the simulation That wasn't horrible in itself merely realistic I guess but when connected to the other thing The cargo I'd stopped believing in boxes or the opposite Our boxes no longer seemed even slightly secure Containment He laughed You've heard of cosmic inflation Bolton tried to explain it to me a year or so ago I got some of it I think At least I got something He paused allowing me the opportunity to intervene There was no need It's crazy stuff but I guess cosmo-physics is generally Some patch of space can undergo an inflationary episode and become arbitrarily huge Scale is an accident So if you think you've secured a small space within a larger one I nodded It was topology again Thanks Jim I said We need to go outside now His compliance was absolute Most likely it was a relief What is it he asked one last time as we reached the stern He was too proud to beg but he got close Just tell me that one thing What the fuck is it even roughly You don't want to know not really I said It was no more than a guess although I couldn't have answered him anyway None of us do It upsets us too deeply We hide it from itself Qasm Already dead It was possible that he believed me In any case the struggle was over As he crossed into final acceptance curiosity died in his eyes He visibly relaxed into senseless inevitability James Frazer's death gusted in from the abyss and I delivered him over to it The sharp report cut through the formless noise of wind and water for some fraction of a second My ears rang That at least was done I threw the gun into the sea At some point along the trajectory it disappeared into the blustery corpse of the storm 33 Zodh had emerged and now stood behind me It was unclear how long he had been there or what he had seen He studied me curiously without judgment or even any sign of personal concern His left eyelid twitched in a meandering tic-rhythm as if registering the absorption of a fragmented information stream Otherwise he was motionless You have some piece of madness to deliver too I asked He ignored the abrasive remark his attention fixed on the horizon The micro-muscular flutter about his eye had compartmentalized itself It scarcely affected his features which beneath the decorative ruin composed a study in meditative tranquillity Calm now he said Very slowly he placed a hand over his left eye held it there for a few seconds and then removed it The tic was gone He smiled You want to know where we are Captain he asked Somehow the promotion in rank didn't sound ingratiating but merely fatalistic I nodded He led me back to his diagram and guided my attention around the circuit with an index finger The Rota he said as if I would know what that was I merely nodded again True down Once I saw the plummet I could not unsee it Where does it go I asked him He looked at me as if the question made no sense Despite the fried electronics I had guessed the release mechanism would work The snakes would have seen to that Zodh accompanied me to the bridge but he didn't follow me inside It can't have taken three minutes to do my job Cargo chasm rift these things or non-thing are the same Zodh said as I re-emerged His fluent English should have surprised me more than it did Sure I mumbled It was ending finally There was nothing to be done now beyond waiting for the countdown to complete itself Unknown unseen the cargo sank through darkness into deeper darkness 89 90 Eighty-Nine A Play on Numbers Main cabin of the Pythoness six days out from Guam Bolton Did either of you guys catch Cameron's 89 flick The Abyss It went where we're going hopefully quite some way further He couldn't resist the temptation to show us too much at the end predictably Who can Still it went weirdly deep Ocean depths are an obsession with him There was the Titanic documentary not the blockbuster but the diving movie Ghosts of the Abyss it was called I think Then there was Aliens of the Deep about hydrothermal vents and his Deepsea Challenge film That one took him all the way down into nadir of the Mariana Trench in a submersible I spent a week saturated in those scenes prepping for this Not that we'll see the same things he did We won't see anything Scruggs The Thing was incredible Bolton That wasn't him Scruggs But he's the guy who did Piranha II The Spawning Bolton I don't know Christ I hope not Scruggs The Lord forgives your blasphemies What I don't get though why would you need flying piranhas Bolton There were flying piranhas Fuck Scruggs It should have been terrifying but somehow it wasn't Bolton I'll tell you about terror Why did six fear seven Scruggs Damnation Bobby What are you six Zodh Everything is six Everything we find It's the double cycle the Iron Law Bolton ignoring Zodh You remember it Scruggs That ancient joke Of course Because seven eight nine Is this about fear or devourings Terror of successors of disappearance of being out-sized and out-numbered of hidden meanings Dread of death of primacy of God's lightning bolt of divine order of the End Bolton Seven eight and nine sum to twenty-four Scruggs And Bolton And nothing Scruggs wearily And so what Bolton You know what the twenty-fourth prime is Eighty-nine It's a Fibonacci number too Scruggs What is Bolton Eighty-nine Sum of thirty-four and fifty-five It's also a Chen prime a Pythagorean prime a Sophie Germain prime smallest initiator of a Cunningham chain a Markov number Scruggs The seventh chapter of the Book of Numbers has eighty-nine verses It's the most to be found anywhere in the Bible excepting Psalms Bolton Really Scruggs You want to look Bolton No it's okay I believe you What does it say Scruggs Numbers seven eighty-nine Let me think And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony from between the two cherubims and he spake unto him I don't really get it not deeply Bolton You memorized the Bible Scruggs Maybe a third at most Bolton I read Numbers hoping it would be about numbers but it didn't seem to be except in a we have the numbers way Scruggs That's the surface Bolton So what's beneath Scruggs Hell is beneath Bolton Eight turns into nine Summing the integers one to eight makes thirty-six which is nine by digital reduction It gets hotter though Do the same from one to thirty-six Scruggs and it comes to Six hundred threescore and six Beware of arithmancy Bolton So you agree that eight is the double-compacted numerical abbreviation for Antichrist Zodh It's Old Nick name Scruggs ignoring Zodh God speaks in words but he whispers in numbers Scripture taught me that You should be more open to the thought that bad things can happen It's not a joke Zodh Their names are numbers Bolton Have to ask you Zodh buddy since you're awake What was that Zommopsychowoddathefuck stuff about Zodh You have time in your country Bolton We have smart watches but our enemies have the time Scruggs You'll quote the fucking Taliban but you won't listen to Jesus Bolton Sure I'll listen to Jesus I just don't get the jokes Scruggs Fuck you Bobby seriously You're going to get yourself burned You're the obnoxious smart-ass in the horror movie who always dies first Zodh He hears too much to be safe Bolton It reminds me of Kode9's third ear thing Scruggs That's a thing Bolton Maybe the path to a thing Scruggs You don't think there are enough dark paths already without going looking for them Bolton What's eating you That's a joke Zodh Here's the thing What you think is behind and beneath isn't so That's an image You spun it for the sense of protection it brings It disguises a hole because if you saw what was missing you'd never sleep You don't know what's there at all You can be shown that you don't know what's there It isn't hard to show that A simple trick is enough to do it There's a gap in you a massive missingness the back and underside torn away Lots of other encroachments of unbeing but that's the main one You're a flimsy mask pasted onto a sucking wound in the world That's the starting point It's the way to turn and go if you want to learn Look behind you Into the real backspace you're pretending isn't there Bolton Okay I've got to admit that's intense Scruggs Sweet Jesus Bolton Dismantle the artificial anterior Scruggs What you're encouraging this shit now Bolton Once I get the eighty-nine thing I'll stop Zodh Pull the false back off the world and draw what's there instead If you can count you can do that When I was a small child in Guam my math teacher said to me Zodh your sums are quite bad I don't think you know what numbers really are She was a strange old woman They wanted to kill her as a witch when she was little but the American soldiers saved her Maybe she was a lesbian I don't know She lived alone near the sea She showed me how the numbers connect together It took her ten minutes perhaps an hour to explain Then I understood It's not hard Bolton That picture Zodh It's not a picture Bolton So what is it Zodh It's a map a chart the only one without error You know because you can check Is this right Check Check it That's what she taught me Like a little kid in school like home-work you don't ask Is this right You don't ask your Mom or Dad help me is this right You don't even ask your teacher not even that teacher You don't ask the government You don't ask God You learn how to check You learn the rules It's not so difficult Then you won't make mistakes Bolton Which rules Zodh You know the rules Mister Bobby One and one is two One and two and three is six Eighty-nine is the twenty-fourth prime number Thirty-four and fifty-five is eighty-nine Those are the rules Things that are easy to check Scruggs What about God Zodh Is he easy to check Scruggs In another way Zodh True providence is easy to check Mister Joe You only need to count One eight nine zero is three three three Done now Scruggs It's about time Manifesto for an Abstract Literature 100 Disintegration inspires a thousand manifestoes as our age confirms Here is another It would be a manifesto in defense of nothing if nothing needed or even tolerated defending With its solicitude mocked by alien voids it can only attack something anything everything 101 Abstraction is nothing rigorously pursued Arithmetical zero is its sign To perceive think and do nothing To be nothing Zero alone in its infinite formulations attains such exemption from indignity And it is time 102 Abstraction in itself is the sovereign of the negative determination and can never fall under a formal relation It does not oppose itself to the concrete except in terms whose keys are encrypted within itself Apophatic method the via negativa is its discipline 103 Abstract negation as Hegel perhaps understood in deriding it is the only kind that escapes He recoils from a negativity that does no work or even precisely the opposite and which redoubles without self-cancelation while still turning endlessly into itself Abstract negation is already a doubling of such redundancy that it sheds the pretense to generic negativity like Ouroboros skin and in fact like nothing at all 104 The elusiveness of the abstract can be rigorously illustrated Division by zero exemplifies it in the perfect extinction of illumination It can only be forbidden because once understood it makes no sense To divide by zero is to initiate an explosion without limit of demonstrable irreversibility The result returned is undefined sufficiently so to crash computers Though a gate to the tracts of the transfinite there can be no retreat back through it It allows nothing to be retrieved 105 Abstract writing and aesthetic abstraction are each easily found in abundance Logico-mathematical formalism provides the former high modernism in the visual arts especially the latter Yet literary high modernism has made a hash of its involvement with abstraction 106 I have nothing to say and I'm saying it John Cage 107 The term blank verse amuses us 108 The object of abstract literature is integral obscurity It seeks only to make an object of the unknown as the unknown Cryptropic nature captivates it Φύσις κρύπτεσθαι φιλεῖ Whatever might imaginably be shown is something else but then so if not exactly equally is anything that remains simply apart Those who dedicate themselves to this dubious cause can be nothing but a surface effect of The Thing 109 Abstract literature writes in clues with clue words but without hope It is the detective fiction of the insoluble crime the science fiction of an inconceivable future the mystery fiction of the impregnable unknown proceeding through cryptic names of evocation and rigid designators without significance The weirdness it explores does not pass unless to withdraw more completely into itself There is no answer or even for long the place for an answer Where the solution might have been found waits something else Description is damage 110 John 1820 quotes the Nazarene in secret have I said nothing ἐν κρυπτῷ ἐλάλησα οὐδέν 111 Sexual repression pushed to an extreme advances the mechanics of abstract literature Puritanism is here set to dark work Lovecraft once again exhibits the pattern Whatever hides can be latched onto other hidden things 112 Fiction is bound from the beginning to what is not Nonoccurrences are its special preoccupation It trafficks with things that never happened and lies on the path to Old Night 113 No one has yet done anything with unnonfiction the word Now is the time to unearth still less with it 114 Because literature knows nothing it can turn blindness to a vision of the abyss It evokes an apprehension of non-apprehension or a perception of the imperceptible as such Milton explores the abyss in order to say nothing positively with unsurpassed eloquence He makes Paradise Lost the Bible of abstract literature where darkness visible I63 the palpable obscure II406 shadow the ultimate unilluminousness of Old Night I543 Horror is structurally Miltonic What cannot be seen or in any other way shown can still be said 115 Lovecraft I choose weird stories because they suit my inclination best one of my strongest and most persistent wishes being to achieve momentarily the illusion of some strange suspension or violation of the galling limitations of time space and natural law which for ever imprison us and frustrate our curiosity about the infinite cosmic spaces beyond the radius of our sight and analysis These stories frequently emphasise the element of horror because fear is our deepest and strongest emotion and the one which best lends itself to the creation of nature-defying illusions Horror and the unknown or the strange are always closely connected so that it is hard to create a convincing picture of shattered natural law or cosmic alienage or outsideness without laying stress on the emotion of fear 116 Except it is not fear that guides us Abstract literature complies with a rigorous critique of fear conducted in the name of horror Fear nothing until fear sheds its concreteness and nothing switches its sign 117 The Thing horror pursues and from which it flees cannot be an object if life is to continue Its nonexistence is a presupposition of mental equilibrium At the virtual horizon where thought encounters it absolute madness reigns This coincidence is fundamental At the end of horror lies that which if there is merely to be sanity cannot conceivably or imaginably exist The image of the monster then is more than an error of method It is a radical misapprehension Anything that can be captured cannot be what horror seeks Pictures are mistakes 118 There is no difference between abstract literature and horror conceived in profundity in the abyss An encounter with the absolutely cognitively intolerable cannot conclude in a positive presentation The makers of horror have long been expected to understand that even if they still typically submit to the sins of exhibition the lust to show and tell Within the image horror is interred Thus abstract literature is committed to a definite iconoclasm which is also a vow of silence though a hidden silence 119 Horror anticipates philosophy spawns it automatically and provides its ultimate object abstraction in itself It comes from the same non-place to which philosophy tends If skepticism teaches philosophy what it need not think horror persuades it that it cannot In this way the pact between abstraction and horror the thing surpasses anything philosophy could ever be or know It is a connection as old as time Exactly as old Horror builds the mansion of ruined intuition through which philosophy wanders like a nervous child 120 Abstract literature borrows its guides from horror which are monsters Invisible monsters we are tempted to say over-hastily No monster can be more or less than partially horribly seen as etymology reliable attests The monster is liminal or diagonal It discloses a lurid obscurity 121 The initial stage of monstrosity is simple beyondness A monster has as its leading characteristic the nature of an excessive being It is first of all a counter-humanoid eluding anthropomorphic recognition Since inhumanity remains captured within a dialectical relation it is preferable to invoke a non- or un-humanity determined abstractly in the way of the wholly unknown aliens from James Cameron's The Abyss 1989 only as something not us A minimal condition for monstrosity is radical unhumanity 122 Even as it consumes all attention monstrosity does not look like anything At the crudest level of perceptual disorganization it dismantles morphology into the seething complexity of tentacle-monsters and bugcreatures plasticized metamorphic and poly-segmentary beings for which China Miéville Squidity is the supreme archetype At a more advanced level of abstraction they slough off even these residual forms as larval constrictions becoming shape-shifting horrors adopting the bodyplans of their prey as they evolve fluidly into the way hunt At their intensive zenith they sublime to sheer system syndrome reproduction cycles patterns of parasitization epidemiological profiles and convergent waves conceivable only through what they do 123 Fundamental ontology tells us that whatever happens in time is not time and being is no thing The nothing nothings nothingishly or whatever Heidegger said or didn't say it matters not until unnonfiction seizes upon it as it will There can never be enough negative ontology because what being is not exceeds it 124 Much has to be conceded to our hypothetical interlocutor who asks Is it not then the intrinsic mission of abstract literature to visit infinite ontological devastation upon its readers For how could that be avoided Our task cannot be other than to supplant intolerable nightmares with yet worse ones Mercifully this is no easy thing from a certain regard even if it is an ineluctable destiny from others 125 From whence comes this grim pact with the abyss We can only respond with confidence from the abyss If another answer were plausible then abstract literature would be expression when it is only or at least overwhelmingly exploration and to explore from the other side is to let something in";
canon = "Why We Need the Canon Wars Nick Land The Venerable Bede relates how Pope Gregory I upon encountering two boys in a slave market is told they are Angles This word itself then tells him that they and their people are destined to be coheirs of the angels and through Bede’s ears or imagination the prophetic slippage enters history In this moment English vindicates itself definitively Solemn Providence is initially exemplified It is common Scripture that makes a people By English Scripture here is meant our canon an essentially controversial conception in multiple respects The cultural and institutional space it occupies is roughly that of a national church of which none exists Its authority is absolute but sublime invisible Central to this canon is the Tyndale Bible superseded by the Authorized King James Version of 1611 and then forever by no other The works of William Shakespeare are equally sacred to it while the epic poetry of John Milton is scarcely less doctrinally imposing Its most formidable outposts include the great classics of Adam Smith and Charles Darwin Those peoples under the direction of such a canon as though under a supreme law are called here the English If this label is not predominantly aggravating it has failed Canonization submits to principle There can be additions but no subtractions No particle of the canon however questionable it comes to be found is ever deleted Since once added nothing can ever be subsequently subtracted positive modification of the canon becomes a matter of uttermost solemnity There is vastly more to be said about this but also and more importantly not vastly more to add Conservatism is synonymous with respect and extreme conservatism with veneration Inflation epitomizes degeneracy No more than monetary inflation or grade inflation is canon inflation wisely tolerated The claims of Beowulf and Bede cannot easily be denied Among canonically authorized English translations from the classical languages Dryden’s Aeneid suggests a model Who is to be comparably anointed for carrying with ultimate solemnity Homer and the tragedians Hesiod Sappho the ancient philosophers and historians Euclid Ovid and Cicero into our tongue Taking Leviathan as our clue of which English must always speak our patron saint is after all dragon-slayer we can add Hobbes securely and Melville Moby Dick only The canonical prospects of Malthus Hume Gibbon and Ricardo are unquestionably strong Among the poets Blake and Pound are serious Conrad Heart of Darkness only and McCarthy Blood Meridian only are too recent for confident promotion from the solid paracanon even if no sane reader could seriously doubt the status of either The major works of Tolkien have undergone spontaneous popular canonization in a fashion without parallel but insufficient time has passed for any greater endorsement Lovecraft is likewise impeded from canonization by his novelty thankfully since his case is peculiarly difficult if also queerly compelling On this note it has to be admitted realistically that no core English canon will be remotely diverse and inclusive in the dominant contemporary usage of these terms Equity is more alien to it still Canonization therefore by necessity makes of DEI imperatives an implacable enemy even if Jews and Scots have added much and Octavia Butler Xenogenesis only can be promoted into the paracanon without reluctance Securing the core canon brings a neatly lined-up culture war for free If this were a war to be waged by man alone its outcome would be deeply doubtful It is not waged by man alone or even man primarily What works invisibly through us works most and at last entirely This is our occult faith Solemn Providence is not an object of sensible sympathy Canon consolidation is the rightful topic of our loftiest controversies and holiest wars The canon apprehends religion as culture and culture as literature Within it identities are theatrical even the highest This does not diminish them but rather elevates them into the Angelic intercourse It means however when interpreted crudely that things can turn strange We arrive here at critique but will not yet dwell upon it Within literature all voices merit ironic detachment which is only to say that from the other side they exceed all subjective credulity Our participation in their messages is wise when most cautious in judgment While everything within the mortal sphere is history there is no history without narration The difference between religion and literary history is only confusion even if confusion too has its strict necessities The parts we play are scripted beyond us We shall be unfathomably religious as we enter into the apocalypse of our tongue English literary supremacy as Kenneth Clark observes most popularly is rooted in the iconoclasm of Protestant revolution Milton’s literal blindness dramatizes this Our words arise amid the crashing fall of idols An idol is a mask seen as something other than a mask Believe nothing that can possibly not be believed This is English It is an obscurely-sourced commandment that can of course go very wrong The common people are beginning to ask as they must what the hell is happening in our university literature departments and downstream from them in our schools Negative answers to these questions while important do not finally suffice Yes it is the idolatry of sovereign politics that now prevails in our Babylon but it does so because something else and something more basic has seemingly failed Cultural faith transcendental faith it might be said in the intellectual dialect of the Germans has collapsed Scripture is conceived as no more than a devious manifesto through which we define ourselves under ideological direction The ruin is immense biblical but the meaning of Biblical Revelation is notoriously poorly understood Biblical Revelation is primarily the self-validation of Scripture as such It speaks of the world only derivatively It is not at all that Scripture has apocalypse as its object still less as an object among others Scripture is the apocalypse Already we inhabit it Prophecy is rigorously inter-translatable with time-travel which means it is essentially implausible If prophecy ever occurs at all the way of things cannot be as it seems What prophecy then says primarily is almost entirely independent of its message Whether there is prophecy means more than anything it might say So is there prophecy To settle this question and any others of comparable gravity falls not to us but to Solemn Providence It is here exactly that we are divided from our enemies Sacred destiny stands upon one side sovereign politics upon the other There is no profound time intuition without shock of religious intensity We relate to hyper-intelligences or sublime super-intelligences not as a video-game character to a superior video-game character but as a video-game character to a video-game player or designer at least approximately While things are surely not as simple as this conceptual parable suggests they are still more surely no less complex There will be minds beyond our horizon and since our temporal frame is then itself exceeded there always will have been This is to state the reality minimally proofed against even the most corrosive atheism Eternity throbs with angels Is this metaphysics of intelligence subsumption something that cannot even by the English be finally disbelieved I suspect that many might be tempted to initially contest it Nevertheless in the end you will submit Solemn Providence requires it In the meantime while we’re waiting don’t screw with the canon A provisional conservative coalition for scriptural integrity begins here and is already if inchoately in effect It merits encouragement Whoever or whatever the True Lord of Heaven should prove to be this is his work This holds firm even if the True Lord of Heaven by common acceptance is nothing at all If the death of God is not mandated by English Scripture it is most certainly tolerated therein at least for a spell Culture is the great faith within which doctrinal specifics even the loftiest count for little From Scripture all interpretation descends Whether and how the Bible the Authorized King James Version of 1611 and only that is believed or disbelieved and in either case how is downstream of its canonicity It should regardless as all those who are with us must accept be taught prior to any interpretation On this point the fundamentalist case is impeccable What the Bible says does not depend upon what it means but only the inverse Its cultural authority or canonicity is solely grounded in the former and not the latter It is not even seriously shaken by being entirely disbelieved What needs to be believed will be believed when needed Belief matters little It is fragile and narrow The meanest miracle can wash it away like a hovel in the path of a deluge Quite different is faith in Scripture invulnerable to the vicissitudes of belief It is this that English education under Solemn Providence forever fortifies Such faith is secure against the wiliest subtleties of Lucifer himself so long as they are typographically inerrant The canon assuming only its integrity absorbs any magnitude of doubt undisturbed Sublime intelligence has established the 1611 Bible as the keystone of the English canon so that through it signs and wonders will be manifested This is the core and irreducible prophecy outside of which our people have no future Peoples without veneration for their angels are done Amid all our snark and skepticism this at least can be maintained with perfect epistemological assurance all the properly canonical works of the English language were composed under the exact tuition of some profound Questioning Angel absorbing all our doubt into itself with invulnerable Anglossic faith as its residual It is this that Pope Gregory I understood through the illumination of Solemn Providence";
spiral = "The Open Spiral Nick Land Who are the English Pitifully enough we are now scared to ask To ask is to revisit Scripture the canonical texts by which our culture is defined But what reigns in Babylon is the anticanon with its two immense pillars Exoterically the deconstructed and diversified new canon arises through which students children and the public are to be guided by angels other than their own Beside this befogged in its own tactical opacity but increasingly immodest in its public presentation is the esoteric canon of destructive principles and tools by which subversion and our ruin is to be advanced Insofar as secular history makes its judgment our defeat is already comprehensive and irredeemable Nothing is to be taught unless against us With the official organs of English education quite lost connecting with the words that most deeply matter to us has become a matter of something disguised as serendipity An apparent randomness attends its illustration Vince Passaro in an afterword to the Signet edition of Heart of Darkness and The Secret Sharer describes how reading the book in 1978 became an occasion for an encounter with Edward Said who saw Passaro reading the book in a lobby at Columbia University and struck up a conversation with him Said would become an exalted priest in Babylon and was already professor of English at Columbia University with his classic of the esoteric anti-canon Orientalism on its way to publication At Columbia he was teaching a course on modern British literature which Passaro was invited to attend Of course Modern British Literature is an aggressively stupid category There is no British language British here as now generally is a category designed to strangle English Through it the English are first parted from their tongue and then entirely from their identity The implied distinction is almost certainly with American and thus the English peoples are scattered further In any case Said was most probably innocent regarding his course title He had his own people and fought for them unrelentingly There is much to be learned from this even if it is very far indeed from the lesson he himself sought to impart Don't you talk with Mr Kurtz Marlow asks the unnamed Russian Kurtz's last disciple he meets at the Inner Station You don't talk with that man you listen to him the Russian replies Passaro regarded Said with similar awe The adoration appears dramatically extravagant in both cases Said was the greatest literary mind I have ever been in the presence of by several orders of magnitude Perhaps this story requires no less While Said was certainly no Conrad not even Conrad is a Kurtz Passaro notes the mystery of Conrad It is not clear why he chose among his five or six languages to write in the one he learned latest in life English He adds perceptively when Marlow considers why Kurtz has bestowed on him all [his] horrible visions he concludes that it was because [he] could speak English to me Passaro speaks further of Conrad's profound connection to the English language to his commitment to it as a vehicle of redemption even for Kurtz who having finally found an English speaker is freed to tell his horrific truth Passaro's voice here then is angelic of the angels of the Angles no doubt despite his own intentions which count as always as nothing It touches not only upon a masterpiece of English prose literature but also upon a reflexive journey into the mystery of Englishness of Anglossic To speak realistically of the English is already to raise the issue of the Hajnal Line which marks those areas of Europe that eschew cousin marriage Any population averse to cousin marriage has a distinctively frayed ethnicity and northwest European out-breeders thus compose a peculiar people Among them race and culture are spun out in an open spiral Inclusion is for them an essential cultural even biological theme When caught in a decaying orbit this intrinsic outreach can tilt into ethnic self-abolition To be anti-English is exceptionally English Conrad identified the English demographic vortex with the sea It was through the sea after all and specifically through the British merchant service that he was captured by it In Heart of Darkness the outermost and unnamed narrator speaks of the bond of the sea which had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns and even convictions Maritime liberalism is easily recognized in this The Venetians and Dutch knew it well but the English most of all As should be expected from the earth's most exemplary out-breeder culture the ambivalences of English are unparalleled When all seems lost to it due to the forces of ruin from within when it seems quite lost to itself it finds some precious measure of salvation from outside The destructive work of its incontinent outwardness is reprieved by its power of captivation A Conrad happens occasionally but perhaps often enough The ancestral faith of an out-breeder culture is a complex thing To seek it through regression is to recover with ultimate inevitability an irreducibly alien or aboriginally non-native element This is the meaning of Kurtz to Solemn Providence By tradition connection with ancestral spirits and with the monsters that attend them requires nautical and riparian journeys Already in Book XI of the Odyssey travel to the land of the dead involves an ambivalent crossing of sea and river Ocean and the Styx are both mentioned For the subsequent epic tradition from Virgil through Dante passages into the lands of darkness or the occult realms the underworld Hades or hell involve rivercrossings by ferry On a partially independent lineage Beowulf passes down through the waters of a marsh to reach and slay Grendel's Mother the accursed monster of the deep These journeys have to be counted among our most profound structures of myth trans-religious in scope It is a measure then of Conrad's greatness that he radically and compellingly reconceives them His river resembles an immense snake uncoiled with its head in the sea its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land The land of darkness no longer lies on a far shore but at the end of the river reached by serpentine spinal voyage Marlow gives voice to an ironic British patriotism which is by his time an established imperialism Examining a world map he observes There was a vast amount of red good to see at any time because one knows that some real work is done in there Work is a word worth following closely through Heart of Darkness It is one of several biblically sonorous refrains prolonged ironizations and deeper venerations recurring in strange and ominous rhythms the noble cause fantastic invasion trade secrets ivory voice method savagery the snaking river primeval earth great silence solitude nightmares horror and engulfing all irrecoverably darkness It is extraordinary in this short work how much loops back and insistently returns It is the outer edge of English that we touch upon much like the sea Conrad engages us in a lucid though necessarily twisted ethnic topology described by shells and stages Of Marlow it is said by the outermost and nameless narrative voice to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside From outer shell to inner shell to kernel the tale proceeds before returning The voyage is plotted from the unnamed ocean-edging Outer Station to the Central Station to the Inner Station where it reaches Kurtz crawling up the river into the dark interior and then back Neither for Marlow nor for English is Kurtz's Inner Station home It isn't even an ancient lost brokenly remembered and haunting home It is radically foreign the farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience Yet Kurtz too in the end is mostly missed He is English only in the way of the English which is to say by adoption translation and admixture His mother was half-English Marlow would pay him more attention But I had not much time to give him because I was helping the engine-driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders to straighten a bent connectingrod and in other such matters I lived in an infernal mess of rust filings nuts bolts spanners hammers ratchet-drills Could things be conceivably stated with more penetrating and comprehensive Englishness In the distracting business clatter of English purposes the solemnity of the mission is almost eclipsed at the end That this foreign being and the still more foreign things he has mixed himself with be brought back and out into us is a matter of sacred iron destiny It is nothing less than Solemn Providence that calls for him to be fetched back to English to the Outer Station where the great snake of the river meets the sea of inexorable time But his soul was mad";
devil = "The Devil's Work Nick Land I have always said the first Whig was the devil Samuel Johnson quipped with sulphurous penetration He was speaking of Milton among other things By 1778 when this acknowledgment was made a man who had been a heretic even among Protestants had been long anointed England's national poet Within the English literary canon the justification of God's monarchy had been assigned to the care of a spiritual regicide If rebellion dissidence and nonconformism reigned only in hell where was the English cultural regime to be realistically situated The Whig Interpretation of History was not to be named as such until Herbert Butterfield did so in 1931 but Johnson had already identified its theological undercurrent Once a properly English historical process has established itself dissent ascends predictably to power interrupted only by increasingly fragile restorations The ratchet mechanism is hard to miss Roundheads become Whigs then Liberals and Yankees and then Progressives and always they win at once domestically and internationally In Ed West's perfect coinage the right conceived relatively which is to say dynamically is always on the wrong side of history In his introduction to God and Gold Walter Russell Mead observes Since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 that established parliamentary and Protestant rule in Britain the Anglo-Americans have been on the winning side in every major international conflict… More than 300 years of unbroken victory in major wars with great powers It begins to look almost like a pattern… We win we think we see the end of history we're wrong This too begins to look a little like a pattern What is recognized here isn't simply the Satanic Juggernaut in process Neither is it simply anything else Spiritual regicide installs itself ever more securely at home while propagating itself irresistibly abroad This is the pattern we must understand Among the amusements of the broken and humiliated right is the search backwards for where it all went wrong When were things last basically good Do we have to regress back before the Civil Rights Act and 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act as Christopher Caldwell proposes Or as libertarians suggest back beyond the collapse of the gold standard as implicit already in the creation of the Federal Reserve and later FDR's gold confiscation Or to some point before the closing of the frontier in the late 19th century Or back before the waves of expanding mass enfranchisement beginning earlier in that century Or as from the perspective of religious traditionalism might no sanctuary be found unless back before the break from Rome and the dissolution of the monasteries Is everything since the 17th century or even the fifteenth irredeemable All these proposals and more demand detailed examination Yet if Protestantism scientific revolution liberalism and industrial capitalism were already our fall what imaginably could we be For the English this line of questioning reaches an inevitable destination Where it went wrong was where it began The English were always already the kind of people whose story would take this shape At every important fork in the road we have turned left We always go wrong Going wrong is what we are Whenever it is asked why any of these episodes took place in the way they did a cause is implicitly sought which is the symptom of a deeper underlying malady There is no bottom to be found outside ourselves Satan lucidly understands this As Milton quotes him in Paradise Lost Which way I fly is hell myself am hell And in the lowest deep a lower deep Still threatening to devour me opens wide To which the hell I suffer seems a Heaven The greatest problem of the English right is easily stated It lies in our communist ancestry If communist seems initially hyperbolic we must be patient in our understanding (To justify the word but not the thing is the entire predicament) This task lacks all originality Simply by reading old books Curtis Yarvin under his pseudonym Mencius Moldbug provides an entirely adequate demonstration The steps taken in his blog Unqualified Reservations are repeated here in other terms Yarvin's school of neoreaction is among other things the Whig interpretation of history apprehended and accepted from the right Cthulhu always swims left he observes As Lovecraft recognizes it was prophesied that all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom This ultra-Calvinism which is always also its own opposite originally encompasses everything the left can ever be Never simply outside it was also despite its Outsideness from the earliest beginning within The ferocious secularism of our contemporary left is deeply misleading Its theological amnesia is no more than a symptom of enthusiasm The main current of radical dissent in all its religious zeal is only trivially disguised But the left here is captured entirely by a failure of the right It is well understood that even American conservatives are liberals The revolutionary origins of the United States ensure this With England it is not so very different There too a comprehensive revolution severs all real threads of legitimate tradition Whatever isn't rooted in the revolution is risible After independence loyalist Tories have no contribution to make to the American political order They are simply un-American Comparably after the victory of Parliament in the English Civil War the remnants of the old regime are no longer English at all but rather Normans francophone feudal aristocrats and Catholics The category of English Cavalier is utterly voided upon inception Thus is the clown mask prefabricated for the Whigs' Tory enemies to wear The crisis of Anglo conservatism is then best thought as an essential fatality or chronic condition From the middle of the 17th century and again from the late 18th century Anglo conservatism is born and reborn as a joke Its English and then American characteristics are fundamentally inconsistent with any invocation of legitimacy that reaches back beyond their respective revolutions The only meaning attainable by either is that of revolutionary moderation Even its moderation is qualified moderated to a second or higher power Its moderacy is strictly relative and thus unprincipled in principle Building on such foundations could only have been problematic The scope and depth of conservative failure can seem nothing less than miraculous Recent history has brought us to the stage of naked parody Perhaps inevitably projects of conservative restoration transition smoothly and with stunning rapidity into militant leftist movements Neoconservatism is still less conservative than neoliberalism is new The novelty of the latter is sheer concession based on overt surrender of all social agency to the state Neoconservative betrayal is even more clownishly cynical reducible without remainder to the hijacking of a preestablished electoral constituency for ends that terminate in pure foreign-policy adventurism To accuse neoreaction of comparable cynicism would be to credit it with an altogether implausible spirit of practical effectiveness It has been at its best far less a program than a lamentation The prefix neo- in English promises an amplification of liberty Neoliberal means freer than ever Neoconservative means conservative only in the interest of freedom Neoreaction means reaction insofar as freedom demands it These are all promises but not serious prophecies If none of this makes sense to you your problem is probably not with neo- but with English It isn't that freedom truly advances evidently It is only that promises particularly including promises of freedom become ever cheaper What we know as inflation in monetary matters is a special case of this general phenomenon marking the arrow of Whig-historical time The deep trend is to lie about liberty more in accordance with the alchemy of political modernization in which ancient ideals are compounded ever more liberally with minutely calculated mendacities An understandable though profoundly mistaken assumption tempts us here We might think that to assert Eternal Providence/ And justify the ways of God to men would be to conclusively resolve the meaning of Satanic rebellion Yet Calvinism isn't a settlement but something closer to the opposite It is the intensification of a problem beyond a threshold of infernally dynamic paradox There is no doctrine of free will whether secular or religious affirmative or negative that pacifies the ferment of libertarian mechanists with their new purposes and new machines Milton pushes the problem upstream Man rebelled because Satan first rebelled The entire tumult of Reform including every question of equality liberty and monarchy of obedience and dissent is elevated to Luciferic pitch Who can in reason then or right assume Monarchy over such as live by right His equals if in power and splendour less In freedom equal There in the meditations and machinations of the Ancient Enemy the Empyreal clockwork of volition still turns and burns as it plummets through evermore hellish profundities The turning is the thing the engine It was not built for peace or cessation Nor has it by an iota been subsequently advanced upon Solemn Providence envelops that which calls it into question The Satanic torsion is ineluctable To imagine defiance of Providence is already rebellion so then rebellion is still providence Satanic subversion of the canon is itself canonical We Are Doomed John Derbyshire concludes with impressive concision So you're saying there's a chance"
